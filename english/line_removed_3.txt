will
remember
the
daycare
sex
abuse
hysteria
that
swept
the
nation
during
the
1980s
and
early
1990s
it
began
with
bizarre
allegations
in
california
that
children
were
being
sexually
abused
and
tortured
by
daycare
workers
in
satanic
rituals1
as
an

the
death
of

jimmy
savile
can
not
have
the
resonance
with
me
that
it
might
for
many
brits
of

think
of

with
the

evoke
nostalgia

are

made

was
never

you
didnt

can

needed

additonally
once
individuals
reached

bravo

i
hope
they
take
real
people

it

be

would
just
have
to
stop
myself
from
laughing

it

however
children

this

we

the

if
were
going
to
acknowledge
that
some
people
under
the
age
of
18
are
mature

to

then
we
should
admit
along

costumes
need
a

a
lot
of
kids
are
not
physiologically
ready
for
certain
modes
of
thinking
i
witness
it
everyday
in
the
classroom
this
is
why
the
concept
of
being
in
a
certain
grade
at
a
certain
age
is
silly
and
kids
will
be
kidsthough
this
does
not
take
away
any
experience
a
kid
should
get
from
a
conseqeunce
as
a
result
of
their
behavior0
when
i
was
at
school
more
than
twenty
years
ago
it
was
emphasised
to
us
by
a
visiting
police
officer
that
getting
a
woman
drunk
to
take
advantage
of
her
was
rape
and
would
be
treated
as
such
by
the
law
not
only
that
but
her
quotation
from
merriam

the
full
quote
unlawful

intercourse
carried
out

the
notion
that
beggars
cheat
is
compounded
by
a
concern
for
the
financial
status
of
otherwise
ablebodied
beggars
people
are
irked
by
the
idea
that
even
a
modest
amount
of
money
should
enable
beggars
to
become
selfsufficient
why
are
they
here
everyday
why
do
they
have
to
beg

ross
thank
you
for
your
comments
i
do
think
that
he
was
clinically
depressed
and
that
his
death
in
light
of
his
writings
sounds
like
suicide
more
than
an
accident
i
think
i
even
mention
that
personal
events
as
well
as
his
burden
which
he
shared
in
his
prophetic
visions
may
have
been
too
much
for
him1
and
youll
have
to
use
whatever
you
find
even
if
its
disgusting
because
little
ones
cant
wait
until
you
find
another
and
there
will
be
the
occasional
accident
for
which
you
wont
be
prepared
bc
by
god
theyre
supposed
to
be
toilet
trained
already
its
never
easy1
so
in
the
state
of
iowa
if
you
are
the
direct
cause
of
harm
to
a
woman
that
is
pregnant
and
that
harm
causes
a
termination
of
the
pregnancy
you
will
be
charged
with
the
murder
of
said
unborn
infant
this
is
aimed
at
exs
who
dont
want
to
pay
child
support
and
get
someone
or
themselves
attack
the
woman
or
causes
the
pregnancy
termination
through
an
action
of
another
crime
bank
robbery
auto
accident
during
the
commission
of
another
crime
etc1
she
was
old
enough
to
get
what
i
was
saying
and
was
definitely
showing
signs
of
being
interested
it
took
a
few
weeks
to
get
from
accidents
and
pull
ups
to
big
girl
underwear
and
pretty
much
accident
free
my
word
of
advice
when
you
do
decide
to
get
started
is
to
not
use
pull
ups
go
straight
to
the
gerber
padded
underwear1
i
came
across
this
post
by
accident
and
i
am
horrified
by
what
happened
to
you
as
well
as
by
the
comments
of
total
strangers
to
your
reaction
it
is
impossible
to
overreact
to
a
violation
of
your
body
only
you
can
determine
how
and
when
your
body
should
be
touched
if
you
think
it
was
wrong
then
it
was1
this
is
why
it
is
important
to
invest
in
a
good
health
plan
that
can
cover
most
medical
expenses
there
should
also
be
some
money
left
aside
to
pay
for
the
deductibles
that
will
need
to
be
paid
in
the
event
of
sickness
or
an
accident
they
may
be
unforeseeable
but
they
can
be
accounted
for
with
diligent
current
on
your
payments
this
keeps
your
credit
score
up
and
will
lower
any
interest
that
you
will
need
to
pay
in
the
future
when
taking
out
a
loan1
our
problem
is
when
do
we
start
leaving
the
house
without
one
on
her
carseat
cover
isnt
machine
washable
damn
you
britax
and
your
1
safety
rating
so
i
hate
the
thought
of
an
accident
in
her
seat
then
what
and
i
feel
like
i
would
probably
faint
if
she
peed
on
the
floor
cuz
it
totally
leaks
through
her
panties
and
coffee
shop
or
something1
i
told
them
that
if
they
peed
in
their
big
girl
panties
they
had
to
clean
it
was
22
years
old
and
she
trained
in
one
day
she
had
one
accident
while
on
the
computer
playing
a
game
and
i
gave
her
a
bucket
and
had
her
clean
the
chair
and
put
her
panties
in
the
laundry
she
seemed
to
like
this
so
i
was
worried
but
she
made
it
to
the
bathroom
every
other
time1
and
if
you
watched
the
accident
unfold
at
the
daiichi
station
the
explosions
basically
showed
you
that
the
spent
fuel
pools
were
exposed
to
the
open
sky
we
in
the

an

for
every

actually
went

reminded
him
to
let

know
if

he
had

after
about
2
days
we
extended

suddenly
one
day
right
before
school
started
she
declared
she
was
using
the
potty
and
that
was
it
she
never
had
a
single
accident
not
one1
as
the
new
york
times
reported
an
employee
by
the
name
of
jdimytai
damour
got
caught
amidst
utter
chaos
in
a
stampede
on
black
friday
resulting
in
his
ultimate
death
sources
say
that
damour
was
literally
trampled
to
death
by
crazed
shoppers
although
no
specific
individual
could
be
called
out
and
held
responsible
for
the
fatal
accident

a

depended
on
the
specific
characteristics
of

reactors
of
which
the

built

before
switching
to
designs
more
like
those
used
in
the

may

are

the
first
day
i
took
her
to
the
bathroom
every
hour
she
only
had
one
accident
and
she
hated
having
pee
run
down
her
leg
as
i
changed
her
i
told
her
that
if
she
to
the
potty
before
1
so
i
have
wondered
for
a
long
time
if
i
could
possibly
have
this
disorder
my
parents
were
in
a
horrible
car
accident
when
i
was
10
and
i
just
really
dont
remember
much
of
my
childhood
i
call
it
my
swiss
cheese
memory1
my
daughter
started
using
the
potty
at
2
12
it
took
her
about
1
month
to
be
accident
free
although
like
any
kid
she
occasionally
has
an
accident
the
best
piece
of
advice
i
received
about
toilet
training
was
to
wait
until
they
are
ready
dont
push
them
because
it
will
just
backfire
on
you1
i
also
do
both
i
did
it
by
accident
though
when
he
was
two
days
old
my
milk
still
hadnt
come
in
so
we
had
to
supplement
with
formula
for
a
day0
i
wonder
i
chose
the
elements
man
rope
climbing
dustbin
head
as
familiar
objects
in
the
perceptual
and
behavioral
world
of
a
laboratory
chimp
but
i
wonder
whether
a
chimp
could
put
them
together
in
this
novel
way
even
by
accident
as
it
were
you
were
provoked
to
perform
your
mental
act
by
my
verbal
suggestion
and
probably
you
often
perform
similar
mental
acts
on
your
own
in
response
to
verbal
suggestions
you
give
yourself
not
out
loud
but
definitely
in
words0
as
for
the
recycled
paper
that
was
a
happy
accident
i
was
simply
searching
for
paper
that
looked
like
paperback
paper
instead
of
typing
paper
now
that
ive
been
working
with
it
for
a
while
i
do
feel
good
about
the
ramifications
of
this
choice
especially
since
as
you
say
were
working
with
a
resource
that
shouldnt
be
wasted0
if
an
oring
design
flaw
caused
the
destruction
of
the
space
shuttle
do
you
insist
that
the
shuttle
wasnt
designed
or
perhaps
just
the
oring
snuck
in
there
by
accident0
that
battle
was
lost
by
the
unfortunate
strategical
opening
by
the
extraordinary
and
unforseen
power
of
the
armored
columns
and
by
the
great
preponderance
of
the
german
army
in
numbers
our
fighter
air
force
might
easily
have
been
exhausted
as
a
mere
accident
in
that
great
struggle
and
then
we
should
have
found
ourselves
at
the
present
time
in
a
very
serious
plight
but
as
it
is
i
am
happy
to
inform
the
house
that
our
fighter
strength
is
stronger
at
the
present
time
relatively
to
the
germans
who
have
suffered
terrible
losses
than
it
has
ever
been
and
consequently
we
believe
ourselves
possessed
of
the
capacity
to
continue
the
war
in
the
air
under
better
conditions
than
we
have
ever
experienced
before0
all
we
can
say
for
sure
is
that
there
is
money
involved
in
there
somewhere
nothing
happens
by
accident
in
the
nfl
somebody
is
making
a
tidy
profit
on
something
schedulerelated0
no
i
am
not
advocating
taking
up
a
religion
just
the
opposite
if
youre
in
one
dump
it
fast
as
instructed
at
revelation
18v4
just
take
up
studying
the
bible
and
find
the
truth
name
yahweh
hebrew
or
jehovah
in
english
i
only
found
out
about
the
last
two
items
blue
beam
and
haarp
apparently
by
accident
from
my
study
of
the
bible
i
knew
the
fruitage
of
jehovah
god
and
what
i
was
receiving
was
not
displaying
that
fruitage
all
the
time
but
it
was
displaying
the
abilities
of
god
and
jesus
so
i
prayed
for
an
answer
next
day
whilst
looking
at

in
amongst
the
many

if

it
would
be
a
shame
to
see
her
pushed
out

82
is
not
62
and
its
reasonable
for
voters
to
consider
advanced
age
when
deciding
who
to
vote
for
this
fall
its
not
ageism
to
observe
that
being
82
poses
certain
health
risks1

its
a
failing
of
ours
in
my
opinion
i
regret
not

was

it
should
be
a
prerequisite
for
anyone
entering

business
today
at

serious

chronic

it
seems
to
me
that
the
subjective
experience
of
accelerating
time
with
increasing
age
is
a
function
of
the
early
age
the
volume
of
remembered
experience
is
small

to
what
it
is
at
an
advanced

situationally

the

the
absence

unjust
wars
and
the

that

using

a
difficult
proposition

of

is
not
driven
by
a
belief
that
this

material
to
awareness
about
the
use
of
minerals
that
may
originate
from
the
democratic

of
the

surrounding

these

will
provide

means
to
draw
attention
to
the
humanitarian
crisis
caused
by

in

with
the
advent
of
these
rules
we
see
an
unprecedented
use
of
the
public
company

as
a
means
to
address
specific

nonetheless
when
they
are
prepared

work
hard

innovate
nonpermanent

can
leave
an
indelible
mark
on
the

during
its

on

in
that
not
only
improved
the
effectiveness
of
the
council
but
also
contributed
to
the
protection
of
civilians
in
armed
conflict
through
its
activism
on
the
angola
sanctions
committee
it
introduced
the
notion
of
naming

shaming
states
that
failed
to
comply

demands
1
the
truth
is
that
there
is
no
univocal
concept
of
war
there
are
various
different
criteria
for
distinguishing
between
wars
and
other
forms
of
armed
conflict
that
are
invoked
in
different
contexts
and
for
different
reasons
what
is
notable
here
is
that
traditional
just
war
theorists
have
not
advanced
any
criterion
of
their
own
that
would
make
it
plausible
to
suppose
that
the
commencement
of
violent

brings
quite
different
principles
into

as
a

a

exists
whenever

state
uses

force
against
another
regardless
of
the
scale
or
duration
of
the
conflict
when
this
happens
something
of
considerable
legal
significance
does
occur
the
law
of
armed
conflict
begins
to
govern
belligerent
relations
between
the
states
but
this
is
a
wholly
conventional
phenomenon
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
what
is
sufficient
to
activate
a

body
of
law
automatically
activates
a
different
set

guerrillas
who
comply
with
the
rules
of

have
nothing
in

are
simply
irregular
troops
conversely
terrorists
disobey
the
laws
of

conflict
by
attacking
civilians
indiscriminately
in

instil

70
the
net
effect
of
the
course
was
to
reinforce
a
distorted
view
of
guerrilla
warfare
and
so
to
provide
a
warped
model
for
counteraction

if

are

counterguerrillas
are

it

ever

dont
be
afraid
to
bring
it
up
for
many
parents
the
race
talk
is
as
difficult
as
the
birds
and
the
bees
talk
dr
tatum
attributes
this
awkwardness
to
a
lack
of
communication
about
race
in
many
of
our
own
childhoods
there
are
concerns
about
saying
the
wrong
thing
intent
says
dr
tatum
sometimes
parents
naively
believe
that
if
they
talk
about
issues
of
race
with
their
children
they
will
cause
them
to
notice
race
in
a
way
that
they
did
not
before
1
yet
only
34
of
parents
have
ever
explained
how
to
balance
a
check
book
with
their
children
at
the
same
time
nearly
two
thirds
of
all
parents
say
that
they
are
more
prepared
to
have
a
conversation
about
the
birds
and
the
bees
with
their
children
than
to
have
a
conversation
about
personal

might
not

be
the
best
way
to
teach
the

my
parents
absolutely
did
not
talk
about
sex
at
all
i
was
given
a
book
by
dr
dobson
which
explained
the
birds
and
the

that
was
determined
to
be
good
enough
my
youth
group
did
a
bunch
of
true
love
waits
campaigns
when
i
was
in
high
school
and
the
basic
message
was
good
christians
dont
have
sex
because
its
dirty
and
disgusting
and
makes
you
used
goods
until
you
get
married
and
then
its
awesome

erroneous

1
this
is
the
second
part
in
a
brief
series
of
posts
looking
at
benjamin
yosts
discussion
of
the
irrevocability
argument
against
capital
punishment
as
explained
in
part
one
the
irrevocability
argument
claims
that
the
death
penalty
is
a
morally
illegitimate
system
of
punishment
because
it
is
not
substantially
revocable
1
the
church
which
conserves
and
develops
the
tradition
disregards
the
improvements
about
fornication
and
blasphemy
while
preserving
real
insights
into
the
good
which
our
ancestors
grasped
namely
that
chastity
and
the
worship
of
god
were
good
conversely
the
church
also
perceives
real
improvements
in
contemporary
culture
such
as
our
rejection
of
slavery
or
of
roasting
people
alive
on
griddles
as
a
form
of
capital
punishment
the
world
being
foolish
simply
declares
that
whatever
we
happen
to
be
doing
right
now
is
obviously
superior
even
if
its
ripping
a
baby
apart
in
its
mothers
womb
1
but
not
every
homicide
is
a
murder
homicide
is
the
killing
of
one
person
by
another
person
murder
is
a
criminal
legal
concept
usually
involving
intentional
killing
of
one
person
by
another
without
justification
killing
of
one
person
by
another
by
accident
selfdefense
or
capital
punishment
are
all
homicides
but
are
not
murder
these
either
lack
intent
or
are
justified
1
argument
do
you
leave
any
room
for
exceptions
such
as
capital
punishment
down
my
throat
for
that
inconsistency
since
i
favor
the
death
penalty
my
usual
response
is
biblical
and
that
even
babies
from
forced
incestuous
tapes
where
the
mothers
life
is
in
danger
deserve
a
chance
because
of
innocence
1
the
covid19
pandemic
and
the
government
responses
to
it
are
creating
some
fissures
in
society
and
testing
the
concept
of
the
rule
of
law
i
personally
would
not
object
to
capital
punishment
for
the
next
person
who
uses
the
phrase
these
unprecedented
times
but
the
unique
situation
nevertheless
presents
some
questions
which
have
been
insufficiently
examined
1
the
governor
shall
have
power
to
remit
fines
and
penalties
in
such
cases
and
under
such
regulations
as
may
be
prescribed
by
law
to
commute
capital
punishment
by
the
house
of
delegates
to
grant
reprieves
and
pardons
after
conviction
but
he
shall
communicate
to
the
legislature
at
each
session
the
particulars
of
every
case
of
fine
or
penalty
remitted
or
punishment
commuted
and
of
reprieve
or
pardon
granted
with
his
reasons
therefor
1
but
not
every
homicide
is
a
murder
homicide
is
the
killing
of
one
person
by
another
person
murder
is
a
criminal
legal
concept
usually
involving
intentional
killing
of
one
person
by
another
without
justification
killing
of
one
person
by
another
by
accident
selfdefense
or
capital
punishment
are
all
homicides
but
are
not
murder
these
either
lack
intent
or
are
justified
1
stoning
to
death
on
adultery
is
again
a
controversial
issue
which
is
not
in
koran
at
in
those
days
for
murderers
since
they
did
not
have
firing
squads
electric
execution
chairs
or
lethal
injections
which
are
there
in
your
country
for
capital
punishment
and
beheading
was
the
least
painful
of
all
deaths
only
for
confirmed
serial
murderers
and
rapists
1
it
is
not
a
question
of
this
or
that
but
rather
it
is
an
issue
of
whatever
it
is
you
want
to
say
i
dont
think
the
issue
is
being
for
or
against
capital
punishment
the
real
issue
facing
our
country
is
the
federal

about

discourse
frequently
bolstered
by
the
language

it
is
of
paramount
importance
that

makes
perfect
sense
to
me
he
had
no
leads
and
decided
not

look

their

collateral

that
sams
never

1
but
whichever
side
of
this
question
one
comes
down
on
the
fact
is
violence
seldom
provides
a
practical
prescription
for
selfdefense
especially
when
faced
with
defending
oneself
against
overwhelming
concerted
and
organized
violence
such
as
that
threatened
and
brought
against
people
every
day
by
the
modern
state
when
a
person
or
a
family
or
a
small
group
of
neighbors
or
likeminded
individuals
find
themselves
oppressed
and
under
constant
assault
by
the
state
their
violent
efforts
at
selfdefense
usually
turn
into
suicide
missions
or
to
be
effective
must
of
necessity
inflict
enormous
amounts
of
collateral
damage
on
innocent
parties
1
but
as
you
can
tell
by
the
fact
that
hesyknow
alive
for
in
part
because
the
bomb
malfunctioned
but
mostly
because
he
couldnt
bear
breaking
his
familys
hearts
or
taking
innocent
lives
his
whole
motive
for
joining
al
qaeda
in
the
first
place
was
his
disgust
with
the
collateral
damage
americas
wars
have
produced
and
in
his
unreleased
obviously
video
suicide
note
he
says
he
set
out
to
kill
the
vice
president
not
because
he
hates
america
but
because
he
loves
it
too
much
to
let

retrieve

constantly
stand

interview
oct

with

amanpour
she
grilled
khan
about
allegations
from
his
opponents
that
he
is
protaliban
because
he
tries
to
engage
with
individuals
affiliated
with
the
movement
a
military
solution
can
never
work
and
that
people
join
the
taliban
for
different
reasons
the
same
is
very
true
for
hamas
the
hearts
and
minds
of
those
who
join
out
of
a
sense
of
survival

because
of
anger
at
the
collateral

from

be
won

before

there
were

rumblings
about

thanks
to

the

of

the
myth
that
democratic

fraud
is
common

that
it

democrats
win

has
become
part
of
the

orthodoxy
in

priebus
the
chairman
of
the

national
committee
wrote
election
fraud
is
a
real
and
persistent
threat
to
our
electoral
system
he
accused
democrats
of
standing
up
for
potential
fraud
presumably
because
ending
it
would
disenfranchise
at

two
of
its
core
constituencies
the

doublevoters
hasen
believes
that
democrats
for
their

have
made
exaggerated
claims
about
the
number
of
voters
who
may
be
disenfranchised
by
republican

measures

he
regards
the
conservative
alarmists
as
more
successful
their
job
is
really
done

many
of

reason

stop

actually
do

about
something

being
more
aware

from
a
philosophical
standpoint
also
not
certain
that
it

worse

believe
that
the
bombers
life
would
have
be
better
utilized
as
a
platform
for
transplant
than
their
chosen
demise
the
real
issue
is
not
philosophical

moral
and
the
only
reason
for
even
considering
a
kidney

from

incarcerated

be

somehow

read
of
how
ivan

captured

what
seemed
most
apparent
was
that
mack
wasnt
a
bad

was
simply
thoughtless

more
concerned
about
making
money
than
taking

0
as

be
pointed
out

in

portions
of
this

i
disagree
with
the
conclusion
of
mg
ryders
team
in
one
critical
aspect
that
being
its
conclusion
that
the
800th
mp
brigade
had
not
been
asked
to
change
its
facility
procedures
to
set
the
conditions
for
mi
interviews
while
clearly
the
800th
mp
brigade
and
its
commanders
were
not
tasked
to
set
conditions
for
detainees
for
subsequent
mi
interrogations
it
is
obvious
from
a
review
of
comprehensive
cid
interviews
of
suspects
and
witnesses
that
this
was
done
at
lower
levels

therefore
when
we
weigh
in
our
hands
and
minds
the
liberty
and
the
life
of
a
detainee
and
ask
ourselves
should
we
let
this
man
go
or
carry
on
as
we
were
what
is
at
stake
what
matters
what
is
it
that
truly
hangs
in
the
balance
morality
humanity
decency
principles
the
courage
to
do
what
is
right
and
pay
the
price
what
is
there
left
in
us

protect

he

an

the
narrative

would
be

entrenched

there
would

that

i
dont

jys

defense

strongly
suggests
that
his
analysis
was
sincere

you
are
absolutely
right
that
someone
has
to
answer

legal
questions

as

i
think
too
many
people
want
to
be
able
to
critize
without
having
to
actually
say
what
they
would
do
in
the

even
though
the

believes
they
do
pose
some
danger
to

merely
means
that

has
determined
that
whatever

can
be
mitigated
by

that
torture

has
increasingly
become
the
rule
in

14
months
since

aggravating
the

is
that
aside
the
widespread
negative
publicity
caused
by
the
virginity
checks
on
a
small
number
of
female

last

the
issue
is
receiving
little
of
the
attention
it

the

which
reduces

stop
such

those

eliminate
the

were
in

were

the

the
most
serious
problem
today
is
the
increased
threat
or
use
of

innumerable
interviews
with
former
detainees
have
revealed
the
use
of
rape
to
be
anything
but
the
haphazard
actions
of
lowlevel
security
personnel
taking
out
their
frustration
on
protesters
whove
politically
humiliated
them
instead
she
explained
that
the
stories
are
so
similar
from

is

policy
in
place
to
use

the
threat
of

thats

should
aim

independence
from

if
you
allow
your
surroundings
to
dictate
your
feelings

simply
affect

too
much

good

the

youre
thrown

surrounded

who
will
no

depress
you1

your

is
so

is
a

who
will
spend
much
longer
in

than
transue
did

is
no

argument
that

its

like
looking

the

is
that

we
must
be
soberly
aware
that
china
is
still
in
the
primary
stage
of
socialism
china
has
not
changed
nor
has
the
principal
problem
in
our
society
that
is
how
we
can
meet
the
evergrowing
material
and
cultural
needs
of
the
people
with
backward
social
production
nor
has
chinas
international
position
as
the
largest
developing
country
in
the
world
we
must
bear
in
mind
under
any
circumstances
the
paramount
reality
that
china
remains
in
the
primary
stage
of
socialism
and
will
long
remain
so
and
base
ourselves
on
this
reality
in
pursuing
all
of
our
endeavors
of
reform
and
development

its
certainly
a
necessity
if
you
have
any
intention
of
taking

responsibility
to

healthfully
which
conservatives
claim

be
a
big
fan
of
some
people
seem
to
think
that
if
its
developing

can
do
without

must
not
be
a
necessity
they
completely
ignore
the
fact
that

i

mr

my

hope
mr

helps
you
get
out

you
live

maybe
he

help
you
seek

you
used

nice

i
know
living

you
have

know

according
to
the
global
movement
the
world
bank
played
a
pivotal
role
in
land
acquisitions
in
several
ways
namely
as
a
source
of
direct
financial
support
for
investments
in
land
as
a
policy
adviser
to
developing
country
governments
and
as
a
standardsetter
for
other
investors
1
among
the
topics
they
consider
are
the
importance
of
knowledge
transfer
from
universities
to
the
market
and
and
the
institutional
infrastructure
that
is
necessary
to
maximize
the
potential
of
science
and
technology
in
doing
so
the
authors
provide
unprecedented
theoretical
and
empirical
contributions
to
the
study
of
nanotechnology
and
more
generally
insight
into
the
complex
business
political
and
cultural
environment
that
must
be
established
in
order
for
such
an
industry
to
thrive
in
the
context
of
a
developing
country1
if
they
dont
like
it
then
theyre
welcome
to
ask
the

to
implement
a
public
option

the
only
developed
country
on
the

who
offers
nothing
in

let
the

run

supposed
to
be
a
shining
beacon
of
truth
justice

recent
studies
of
sensation
have
argued
in
particular
that
it
is
time
to
heed
the
interaction
of
supposedly
distinct
senses
and
to
think
about
new
constellations
of
sensory
experience
whether
they
take
the
form
of
the
neurologists
multimodal
sensory
integrations
or
the
alternative

organs
described

these

scientifically

this
women
do
not
play
the

quoted

what
i
find
shocking
is
the

seriously
concerned
that
excessive
class
size

substandard

substantially
disadvantaged
our
public
school
children
yet
there
was
little
data
available

delineate
the

the
problem0
we
should
fully
and

open
competitive

make
the

and
ensure
that
honest
people
are
not

not
have
their
way
we
should
improve
the

the

open
the
suggestion
that
the

had
been
on

combustible
rhetoric
the
court
struck
an
awkward
balance
between

i
went

read

id
missed
and
i
recall
it
as
one

worst
experiences
ive
had
in
reading
for
pleasure
its
likely
my
expectations
were
set
much
too
high
by
what
people
say
about
it
but
the
issues
with
it
were
so
glaring
that
i
have
to
suggest
dislike
of
it
can
not
be
dismissed
as
a
matter
of

i
used
to
get
really
upset
when
a

bs
to
me

now
i
realize
they
seriously
believe
we
can
sustain
this
while
forcing
obamacare
down
everyones
throat
as
if
it
wont
impact
the
small

that
employee
a
majority
of
americans
they
then
boycott
companies
that
are
being
forced
to
downsize

afford
obamacare
which
of
course
only
ensures
cutting
employees
that
they
claim

supporting
with
their

im
not

really
how
can
anyone
with

what
is
going
out
is
way
more
than
whats
coming
in

i
am
not
spinning
the
numbers
these
are
the
facts
you
should
know
that
when
companies
downsize
they
never
hire
people
back
again
i
worked
for
2
companies
that
did
it1
not
all
downsizing
is
the
same
if
they
choose
to
downsize
by
pulling
out
of
an
unprofitable
market
that
is
one
thing
but
competing
in
a
market
and
failing
is
eventually
going

catch

there
are

from
civics
class
you
may
remember
that
the
21st
amendment
to
the
constitution
formally
ended
prohibition
in
1933
but
while
the
amendment
made
it
once
again
legal
to
sell
and
produce
alcohol
it
also
contained
a
measure
designed
to
ensure
that
america
would
never
again
have
the
horrible
drinking
problem
it
had
before
which
led
to
the
passage
of
prohibition
in
the
first
place
specifically
the
21st
amendment
grants
state
and
local
governments
express
power
to
regulate
liquor
sales
within
their
own
borders
thus
the
existence
of
dry
counties
and
blue
laws
of
states
where
liquor
is
only
retailed
in

of

gave
results
that
were
virtually
indistinguishable
from

by

the

therefore
concluded
that
the

likely

peed

a

after

as

touch
a

stuffed

wattle
in
a
canning
jar
and
put
it
on

that
if

killed
us

this

mess
up

still
needed

to
comprehend
the
human
cycle
with
any
degree
of
clarity
it
is
essential
to
comprehend
that

body
is
a
constantly
changing
mass
of
material
elements
while
the
soul
is
eternal
the
soul
takes
a
body
just
before
birth
and
plays
its
part
as
a
baby
infant
child
adolescent
adult
and
an
elderly
person

then
leaves
the
body
to
take
another
body

go

intact

adding

voucher
program

deciding
which
is
more
lucrative

would
naturally
choose

a

american
association

the
episode
started
off
kind
of
funny
with
kandi
being
presented
in
the
airing
for
a
short
time
but
only
a
short
time
alan
gets
seduced
by
one
of
his
elderly
neighbours
and
then
she
dies

with
an
older

yeah
that
is
weird

not

hm
do
you
know
more
patients
die
from

from

from

most

by

most

these
are
facts

i
dont
understand
precisely
what
wed
have
them
debate
are
we
talking
the
merits
of
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
or
the
definition
of
torture
if
thats
the
case
is
it
a
good
idea
to
put
one
person
who
has
now
devoted
a
good
amount
of
his
professional
life
to
discussing
the
issue
and
defending
his
views
on
it
against
one
who
hasnt

let
s
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
she
did
not
know
they
were
waterboarding
pelosi
says
she
was
briefed
by
bush
administration
officials
on
the
legal
justification
for
using
waterboarding
but
that
they
never
followed
through
on
promises
to
inform
her
when
they
actually
began
using
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
where
is
her
objections
to
even
a
consideration
of
using
tactics
that
she
now
defines
as
torture
this
is
the
dumbest
woman
to
ever
hold
office
1
in
that
or
any
other
briefing
we
were
not
and
i
repeat
were
not
told
that
waterboarding
or
any
of
these
other
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
were
used
what
they
did
tell
us
is
that
they
had
some
legislative
counsel
opinions
that
they
could
be
used
she
told
reporters
today
1
which
brings
us
to
the
only
real
question
here
is
it
permissible
to
torture
somebody
as
punishment
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
used
by
the
us
in
recent
years
which
defenders
claim
are
a
means
of
extracting
vital
lifesaving
information
re
re
1
mostly
everyone
is
against
waterboarding
or
enhanced
interrogation
techniques
i
guarantee
9
out
of
10
people
would
change
their
minds
if
after
a
horrific
event
they
were
asked
if
they
were
still
against
these
techniques
knowing
it
could
have
prevented
them
i
do
nt
quite
understand
why
we
have
so
much
sympathy
for
people
who
want
to
cause
so
much
harm
and
chaos
but
we
wo
nt
hesitate

unfortunately

flout

rocked

kyrgyzstan
last
month
one
georgian

claimed
that

has
been
behind

indeed
georgians
see
a
russian
hand
in
everything
that
goes

one
thing
that

it
isnt
often
reprehensible

it
is
always
reprehensible

you
were
informed
about
this
but
am
so
disappointed
as
a
supporter
of
palestinian
rights
i
am
disgusted
1
there
was
no
israeli
identity
you
are
making
up
the
concept
of
an
israel
and
saying
that
this
anachronism
is
on
equal
footing
with
the
majority
population
that
was
ethnically
cleansed
by
the
european
colonists
european
jews
who
stole
their
land
and
homes1
so
when
shtf
there
it
was
literally
unimaginable
to
the
majority
of
the
yugoslavian
people
that
things
could
ever
get
anywhere
near
that
bad
imagine
if
shtf
and
a
civil
warethnic
cleansing
war
happened
in
nyc
its
completely
unimaginable
but
thats
exactly
what
the
citizens
of
sarajevo
thought
theres
a
great
scene
in
the
beginning
of
the
hbo
bosnian
war
drama
shot
through
the
heart
where
a
family
is
coming
home
from
a
normal
night
out
and
as
theyre
driving
down
the
road
they
come
upon
an
armed
government
roadblock
1
its
purpose
is
to
adjudicate
disputes
among
states
the
court

heard
cases
related

illegal

among
others

the
sensory
input
modality
of
a
complex
story
is
totally
irrelevant
all
that
matters
is
how
it
jointly
activates
a
host
of
interrelated
concepts
in
such
a
way
that
further
concepts
eg
ethnic
cleansing
are
automatically
accessed
and
brought
up
to
center
stage
thus
highlevel
perception
is
a
kind
of
misnomer
when
it
reaches
the
most
abstract
levels
but
i
dont
know
what
else
to
call
it
because
i
see
no
sharp
line
separating
it
from
cases
of
recognizing
french
impressionism

israels
actions
took
place
in

they
can
not
be
compared
to
a
deliberate
ethnic
cleansing
of

of
a
certain
population
in
peacetime
yes
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
palestinians
were
in
fact
a
long
settled
population
even
if
if
they
were
not
ethnically
cleansed
but
enemy
civilians
who
fled
after
their
side
was
defeated
however
it
is
arguable
that
the
the
original

can
not
reasonably
be
inherited

all
i
will
say
is
that
i
dont
think
that
oppressoroppressed
are
theoretical
terms
i
think
that
the
facts
of
palestinian
oppression
are
wellestablished
i
dont
subscribe
to
a
blame
model
either
but
we
also
need
to
realize
that
without
acknowledging
the
truth
of
palestinian
suffering
and
its
causethe
ethnic
cleansing
by
jewish
forces
as
well
as
the
denial
of
palestinian
rights
to
selfdetermination
by
the
international
communitywe
can
not
move
towards
any
reconciliation
process
that
is
necessary

coexistence

they

let
me
explain
suppose
i
read
a
newspaper
article
about
the
violent
expulsion
of
one
group
of
people
by
another
group
from
some
geographical
region
and
the
phrase
ethnic
cleansing
nowhere
present
in
the
article
pops
into
my
head
what
has
happened
here
is
a
quintessential
example
of
highlevel
perception
but
what
was
the
input
medium
1
for
example
one
will
tell
you
about
the
massacre
in
lod
an
ethnically
cleansed
village
between
jaffa
and
jerusalem
another
a
story
about
two
nuns
being
shot
in
the
head
in
qatamon
an
ethnically
cleansed
neighbourhood
in
west
jerusalem
a
third
will
tell
you
about
shooting
200
camels
and
another
about
how
a
guy
threw
a
grenade
into
a
house
where
there

the
fact
that
the
establishment
of

is
not
mentioned
in
any
of
the
clauses

thus
leaving
the

the

1
their
idea
was
to
create
a
jewishonly
or
at
least
overwhelmingly
jewish
state
in
palestine
naturally
there
were
people
already
living
in
this
area
who
would
have
to
be
removed
ethnically
cleansed
in
order
to
make
this
happen

all
the
prebirth
scanning

testing
is
so
prone
to
error
a
close
friend
who
was
expecting
her
third
child
was
hounded
to
have
an
abortion
because
the
analysis
from
all
the
scans
and
tests
reported
that
her
baby
would
be
severely
malformed
fortunately
she
resisted
the
pressure
and
gave
birth
to
a
beautiful
baby
girl
who
didnt
have
any
of
the
deformation
predicted

has
since
grown
up

my
son
was
born
was
eight
weeks
premature
due
to
complications
that
arose
during
the
later
part
of
my
pregnancy
i
was
told
i
would
not
be
able
to
conceive
prior
to
my
pregnancy
and
when
we
found
out
we
were
expecting
i
was
terrified
and
thrilled
at
the
same
time
that
god
had
blessed
me
i
was
told
at
a
routine
exam
there
were
complications
and
was
sent
to
a
hospital
more
equipped
for
to
handle
we
were1
were
expecting
our
second
any
day
now
cm
on
kiddo
our
first
was
a
boy
and
now
were
going

one
of
each
1
his
phd
is
in

very
technical
scientific
field
and
i
have
a
very
hard
time
understanding
his
research
with
my
basic
science
knowledge
reading
this
made
me
realize
that
maybe
i
havent
put
enough
effort
into
supporting
him
and
understanding
the
pressure
he
is
under
we
are
expecting
a
baby
later
this
year
so
there
is
pressure
for
him
to
find
a
good
job
right
away
after
he
graduates

bright

are
bored
by
material
that
lacks
intellectual
challenge
and
by

work
that
constantly
sets
them
up

able
students
expecting
a

is
not
realistic
therefore
i
believe
there
should
be
more
specialization
even
at
the
lower
levels
so
that
the
individualized
lessons
needed
to
meet
all
students
needs
in
each
subject
could
be
developed
by
a
specialist
who
only
prepares
for
his

what

that
his

if

a

dr

said
getting

in

like
nigeria
where
the

are
very
secretive

cagey
especially
with
the

of

be
a
herculean
task
again
when
we
look
at
it
from
the

released
by

far
one
can
conveniently
argue
that
the
fatality

is
more
than
one

projected
by
who
he
stated

will
see
a

between

the

rate
in

current

and
israeli

as
it
is
doing
now
after
all
theyre
not
terrorists
theyre
freedom
fighters
the
only
thing
is
im
still
trying
to
figure
out
whose
freedom
theyre
fighting
for
because
it
surely
isnt
for
the
lebanese
that
theyre
doing
this

they
plot
incite
and
instigate
the
root
cause
for
such
acts

stood
up

there
are

that
the

that
happen
when
the

up
are
frequently
exaggerated
you
only
believe
one
percent
of
it
never
happened
but
we
hear
about
it
anyway
about
the
actor
dressed
like
a
lobster
smoking
a

in
the

about
the
actor
who
got
severely
coked
up
on
his

do
an
interview
about
getting
clean
about

another

we

about

i
dont
mind
spending
a
little
money
helping
people
who
have
gone
through
an
earthquake

sp
america
has
always
helped
those
in
need
and
should
be
proud
of
that
effort

prefer

to
drink
to
some

kid
getting

to
go
to

when
he
hasnt
even
learned
to
read0
when
talking
with
seamus
about
the
ideas
that
would
become
metaresolver
our
hypothesis
was
that
mobile
advertising
isnt
really
delivering
the
value
it
should
be
able
to
given
how
much
time
folks
spend
on
their
phones
and
we
had
a
feeling
that
getting
clean
data
into
the
hands
of
advertisers
was
the
way
to
solve
that
the
setup
around
the
opportunity
in
mobile
advertising
is
well
documented
0
and
if
you
can
not
see
how
this
issue
is
so
deeply
interconnected
with
all
of
the
above
with
racism
with
violence
on
woc
with
rape
culture
with
colonialism
with
our
disdain
for
people
from
the
global
south
with
whose
bodies
are
deemed
human
and
whose
are
not
and
as
such
unrapeable
with
institutionalized
violence
with
wars
waged
by
our
nations
on
the
countries
where
these
people
come
from
if
you
can
not
see
all
of
this
as
part
of
the
same
landscape
as
part
of
the
same
gigantic
oppressive
shit
puff
pastry
then
maybe
i
should
not
call
myself
a
feminist
maybe
indeed
throwing
flames
in
the
direction
of
feminism
is
all
i
have
left
1
and
you
can
not
celebrate
these
three
specific
african
women
without
situating
yourself
in
their
realities
and
the
realities
of
all
woc
around
you
without
asking
yourself
why
your
movement
has
been
so
often
accused
of
alienating
woc
of
not
acknowledging
the
legacy
of
slavery
and
colonialism
in
rape
culture
of
not
actively
opposing
violence
against
woc
and
without
examining
the
role
that
your
state
has
had
in
the
on
going
persistent
violence
perpetrated
on
people
from
the
global
south
even
today
as
i
type
this
unless
your
feminism
is
actively
engaged
in
all
of
this
multi
dimensional
analysis
you
have
no
right
claiming
these
women
as
your
own

this
song
is
about
a
girl
trying
to
convince
a
guy
to
go
all
the
way
meaning
to
have
sex
with
him
carmen
told
blender
magazine
in
2006
that
he
was
inspired
by
the
rolling
stones
performance
of
lets
spend
the
night
together
when
mick
jagger
had
to
sing
it
as
lets
spend
some
time
together
says
carmen
i
knew
then
that
i
wanted
to
write
a
song
with
an
explicitly
sexual
lyric
that
the
kids
would
instantly
get
but
the
powers
that
be
couldnt
pin
me
down
for
1
when
i
finally
escaped
that
relationship
at
the
age
of
fourteen
i
had
skewed
ideas
about
sexual
relations
although
jerry
never
made
me
go
all
the
way
i
had
fooled
around
quite
a
bit
finally
at
the
age
of
seventeen
i
had
my
first
girlfriend
whom
ill
call
sarah
1
they
are
vile
and
disgusting
but
they
exist
there
are
women
that
go
all
the
way
and
try
to
falsely
accuse
guys
of
rape
in
fact
the
last
one
happened
to
a
guy
in
the
town
i
grew
up
in
1
everyone
knows
this
and
its
not
like
no
ones
been
trying
to
do
anything
about
it
either
but
were
still
going
to
need
more
of
them
than
we
have
im
not
predicting
that
were
going
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
a
world
where
young
healthy
people
with
access
to
the
best
medical
care
die
because
they
decided
to
play
tennis
without
their
socks
on
but
were
certainly
in
danger
of
a
much
nastier
world
than

merck

out
with

interesting

theyve
been

there
were
times

joy
particularly
with

then
something
would

the
short
version
i
tried
to
commit
suicide
because
i
became
so
angry
at
the
person
who
stabbed
me
in
the
back
and
god
for
allowing
it
to
happen
and
the
fact
of
what
was
happening
i
felt
hopeless
and
i
had
worked
so
hard
and
did
the
best
i
could
and
then
a
couple
days
before
halloween
2006
i
laid
down
on
highway
370
at
about
midnight
hoping
to
go
to
heaven
early
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i
did
it
right
and
that
i
get
this
miserable
life
over
with1
jesus
died
but
extremely
small
group
of
people
was
informed
about
his
death
and
the
significance
of
his
mission
those
who
have
heard
about
the
event
jesus
death
some
of
them
were
good
did
not
sin
and
went
to
heaven
and
other
were
bad
did
not
give
a
shit
for
jesus
and
his
death
and
went
to
hell
ok
they
were
informed
they
had
opportunity
to
make
the
right
choice

if
some
of

went

they
deserved

now
well
into

clings
to
the
long
discredited

hypothesis
carletons

lindseys

was
that

im
retired
after
30
years
of
service
to
the
citizens
of
our
state
and
community
each
month
i
have
to
decide
what
are
more
important
groceries
or
prescription
medications
past
presidents
senators
and
representatives
can
retire
after
8
years
with
greater
benefits
than
i
receive
and
they
dont
have
to
worry
about
whether
or
not
there
is
social
security
and
medicaid
when
they
hit
their
60s
because
they
voted
themselves
a
much
better
package
for
their
financial
and
health
situation
in
their
golden
years
lets
face
it
our
leaders
suck
in
this
country
republicans
and
democrats
1
i
dont
begrudge
them
that
what
makes
me
angry
is
that
the
younger
ones
insist
that
none
of
it
ever
happened
and
they
will
not
talk
to
my
parents
about
it
because
it
would
absolutely
destroy
my
parents
in
what
should
be
their
golden
years
to
know
that
i
say
such
things
happened

paul
ryan
is
proposing
a

increase
to
middle
class
americans
in
the
name
of
medicare
if
you
peal
back
the
skin
on
what
he
is
proposing
it
is
no
more
than
a
tax
increase
with
a
different
name
the
net
result
is
the
same
approximately
6000
a
year
less
you
will
have
per
senior
for
a
married
couple
that
is
12k
per

they
did
not
have
factored
into

master
plan
and
it
will
go
up
exponentially

increases
so
to
take

the

figures
come
out

are
summed
up
in

graph

only
about
48
percent
of
current

households
will
be
ready
for
to
pack
it
in
and
enjoy
their
golden
years
by
the
traditional
retirement
age
of
65

thanks
in

to
the
premium
social

recipients
get
from
delaying

86

the
reality
is
that
they

todays

theres
not
enough
time

do
it
all

way
he
is
still
the
one
paying
most

until
i
finish
my

and
people
are
okay
with
that
so
long
as
they
view
the
relationship
as
monogamous
it
could
be
some
socially
constructed
reciprocity
of
man
being
breadwinner
and
woman
homemaker
or
something
more
instinctual
i
surrender
that
thought
to

data
overlaid
with

showing
key
tax
code
changes
as
well
as
income
inequality
data
across
that

xaxis
the

certainly
documents
what
spending
leaves
the
middle
class
paying
for
more
of
the
education
and
health
care
out
of
pocket
and
allows
the
wealthy
to
take
more
than
their
fair
share
of
our
economy
which
they
spend
on
themselves
vacationing
abroad
c
or
investing
in

well
living

myself
i
think
there
are
a

of
people
who
having
experienced
the
impoverishing
and
disenfranchising
hartz
iv
process
are
most
likely
to
disagree
1
these
numbers
could
not

congress

be
debating
whether

not

whether
to
cut

dont
call
it
a

if
you
dont
want
to
but
its
misleading
and
irresponsible
i
did
modify
some
language
in
the
post
to
reflect
that
he
spent
more
of
his
talk
on
income
inequality
than
on
the
ecosystem
theory
of
job
growth
henry
ford
said
the
same
thing
that
he
cant
sell
cars
if
the
people
who
make
lot
of
other
things
too
some
of
which
were
completely
insane
1
you
know
germany
is
a
lot
more
liberal
sensu
usa
than
spain
germany
has
better
environmental
and
labor
much
less
income
inequality
higher
salaries
more
decent
politicians
spain
has
the
highest
income
inequality
of
all
of
europe
less
government
transparecy
much
much
more
corruption
nepotism
and
cronyism
1
instead
theyve
been
talking
about
issues
like
income
inequality
by
emphasizing
mitt
romneys
immense
wealth
and
the
fact
that
completely
legally
he
paid
a
lower
tax
rate
in
2010
than
many
other
americans
have
although
he
did
of
course
pay
far
more
in
taxes
theyve
been
talking
about
romneys
experiences
at
bain
to
the
point
of
trying
to
hold
him
responsible
for
events
that
he
likely
didnt
have
very
much
control
over
and
events
that
occurred
after
hed
left
daytoday
management
of
the
company
1
because
consistently
topcoded
public
use
and
internal
data
do
not
contain
information
about
the
very
highest
incomes
they
understate
the
level
of
income
inequality
however
once
the
break
between
1992
and
1993
is
controlled
for
income
inequality
based
on
all
these
data
series
yield
the
same
trends
namely
a
rise
in
inequality
between
1975
and
1992
followed
by
a
significantly
smaller
increase
in
inequality
after
1993
1
say
what
you
will
about
income
inequality
being
to
blame
jpd
and
anyone
else
districts
in
the
st
louis
area
is
that
they
are
generally
both
drastically
underfunded
and
terribly
mismanaged
and
i
strongly
believe
that
both
of
those
problems
could
be
solved
with
smart
measured
intervention
from
the
state
andor
federal
government
1
incomes
become
more
equal
only
with
the
emergence
of
democratic
pressures
brazil
broadly
follows
this
pattern
it
had
high
initial
levels
of
inequality
and
until
the
late
80s
income
inequality
was
still
increasing
it
is
only
now
that
high
growth
and
development1
people
a
bit
from
ensuring
basic
needs
honestly
making
enough
to
survive
is
not
a
capitalistic
pursuit
it
is
a
desperate
need
of
all
those
that
need
to
survive
in
a
system
based
upon
wealth
and
income
inequality
and
private
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
and
distribution
1
here
is
an
older
paper
which
finds
that
changes
in
earned
income
inequality
can
not
even
explain
half
of
the
change
in
family
income
inequality
from
19791996
among
the
causes
for
the
rest
of
the
increase
in
inequality
are
growing
positive
correlation
of
husbands
and
wives
earnings
ie
mate
selection
as
in
the
explanation
of
the
political
calculation
blog
and
a
sharp
decline
in
the
proportion
of
americans
who
live
in
families
where
a
married
couple
is
present
1
there
are
two
issues
with
using
this
sort
of
scheme
to
address
income
inequality
most
glaringly
it
doesnt
all
get
spent
on
the
poor
or
even
on
people
1
one
final
general
point
before
turning
to
the
specifics
people
who
have
looked
at
this
document
in
the
past
often
asked
whether
progressive
taxation
reduces
some
of
the
income
inequality
that
exists
before
taxes
are
paid
the
answer
not
by
much
if
we
count
all
of
the
taxes
that
people
pay
from
sales
taxes
to
property
taxes
to
payroll
taxes
in
other
words
not
just
income
taxes
1
just
look
at
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
data
the
unemployment
rate
for
those
with
a
bachelors
degree
is
38
percent
for
those
with
some
college
or
an
associates
degree
it
is
69
percent
for
those
with
a
high
school
degree
it
is
84
percent
and
for
those
who
did
not
make
it
out
of
high
school
it
is
122
percent
education
and
enhanced
social
mobility
is
essential
to
addressing
income
inequality
and
the
estate
while
the
increase
in
the
estate
tax
threshold
would
ease
a
burden
on
the
wealthy
the
next
step
takes
back
what
was
giveth
it
is
time
to
establish
meanstested
copayments
for
medicare
1
perhaps
the
most
common
measure
of
income
inequality
in
a
nation
is
the
gini
coefficient
aka
the
gini
ratio
which
ranks
the
amount
of
inequality
which
represents
perfect
equality
where
everyone
would
have
an
equal
share
of
the
nations
income
to
a
value
of
1
which
represents
perfect
inequality
where
one
person
would
have
all
the
income
but
everyone
else
has
none
1
this
is
one
reason
why
income
inequality
has
appeared
to
increase
in
recent
decades
this
kind
of
entrepreneur
works
several
years
for
very
little
money
building
a
business
and
then
gets
paid
off
all
at
once
when
the
company
is
sold
so
while
there
is
always
a
steady
drizzle
of
energy
and
tech
people
making
millions
of
dollars
in
a
given
year
they
are
not
the
same
people
from
one
year
to
the
next
1
but
it
is
sometimes
said
that
income
inequality
is
reduced
significantly
by
government
programs
that
matter
very
much
in
the
lives
of
lowincome
americans
these
programs
provide
transfer
payments
which
are
a
form
of
income
for
those
in
need
1
during
the
60s
70s
and
80s
it
achieved
staggering
growth
rates
averaging
184
a
year
between
1962
and
1979
but
as
the
chart
below
shows
it
also
retained
low
levels
of
income
inequality

i
wasnt
old
enough
to

on

nor
were
most
of
the
people
that
were
gathered
at
some
dingy
punk
house
on
ne
14th
place
but
we
were
there
and
watched
with
horror
as
the
race
was
dead
even
and
inebriated
beyond
comprehension
as
things
dragged
on
until
the
eventual
crowning
of

the
fact

i
was

inebriated
when
the
first
rape
began
facts
and
bragging
are
separate
issues1
he
propositioned
her
for

now
he
knew
she
was
inebriated
thats

the

answered

was
inebriated
to
the
point
of
incoherence
and
from
what
we
could
gather
from
his
slurred
remarks
he
was
the
that
point
1
her
allegation
in
a
sworn
declaration
she
said
that
in
and
engaging
in
abusive
and
physically
aggressive
behavior
toward
girls
she
claimed
that
kavanaugh
and
others
would
get
girls
inebriated
so
they
could
be
gang
raped
in
side
rooms
at
house
parties
by
a
train
of
numerous
boys
i
have
a
firm
recollection
of
seeing
boys
lined
up
outside
rooms
at
many
of
these
parties
waiting
for
their
turn
with
a
girl
inside
the
room
these
boys
included
mark

and
brett

added
that
in

she
was

1
that
was
precisely
my
point
its
just
that
my
comments
got
disconnected
my
roommate
used
to
describe
the
school
he
taught
at
as
such
even
though
inner
city
means
nothing
as
a
geographic
description
of
pg
county
he
used
it
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
his
school
was
majorityblack
and
underperforming
by
nclb
standards
1
they
learn
to
use
a
camera
and
play
the
guitar
just
because
they
think
camps
in
the
summer
to
get
better
and
better
at
what
they
are
passionate
about
learning
why
should
we
expect
children
in
our
public
inner
city
schools
to
go
without
because
we
are
afraid
that
another
kind
of
instruction
will
somehow
be
diminished
or
marginalized
as
if
in
the
end
one
way
of
getting
turned
on
and
receiving
instruction
is
all
a
child
needs
to
get
a
quality
arts
education
or
that
one
way
is
more
important
or
valuable
than
another
1
the
reason
lies
in
the
fact
that
we
have
an
allvolunteer
force
which
is
predominantly
composed
of
people
who
come
from
the
lower
socioeconomic
strata
meaning
that
their
families
have
very
little
economic
or
political
clout
especially
over
the
last
ten
years
when
volunteering
for
the
armed
forces
has
meant
probably
being
sent
into
combat
in
either
iraq
or
afghanistan
most
of
the
people
who
have
enlisted
have
either
come
from
rural
areas
where
there
are
few
opportunities
to
be
had
or
the
inner
city
where
military
service
probably
offered
the
best
chances
of
a
comparatively
wellpaying
career
that
is
still
legal
and
which
potentially
presents
the
opportunity
to
learn
useful
skills

my
old
roommate
is
a
high
school
teacher
in
a
pg
county
high
school
just
south
of
dc
he
used
to
say
that
his
work
really
drove
home
the
point
that
inner
city
especially
when
used
to
describe
schools
is
just
a
euphemism
for
poor
students
of
color
there
is
nothing
at
all
urban
about
southern
pg
county
but
demographically
and
performancewise
it
was
the
stereotypical
innercity
school1
again
context
is
king
this
speech
of
inner

youth
who
had
fought
their
way
through
crime
and
drugs
to
graduate

horrible
frightening
people
thankfully
those

people
are

faulty

having

the
better
part
of
26
years
working
from
the
inner

to
the
rez
i
can
tell
you
that
what
is
being
pawned
as
education
reform
has
very
little
to
do
with
improved
educational
outcomes
and
very
much
to
do
with
profit
and
the
continued
marginalization
of
both
students
and
teachers
the
vultures
are
circling
1
in
the
us
people
tend
to
lord
over
how
much
critical
thinking
is
taught
in
american
schools
as
opposed
to
the
asian
system
of
rote
learning
s
really
the
case
i
had
an
average
american
public
school
experience
so
i
didnt
go
to
a
poor
inner
city
school
nor
did
i
attend
a
fancy
private
school
in
most
of
my
classes
the
teachers
just
had
you
sit
quietly
and
fill
out
some
stupid
worksheet
that
could
be
completed
by
reading
the
chapter
and
filling
in
the
blanks
in
sentences
lifted
almost
word
for
word
from
the
textboook
1
one
at
this
point
could

the

venkatesh
the
one
study
that
ive
seen
which
is
interesting
is
that
as
your
income
rises
the
percentage
of
your
trade
the
kinds
of
things
that
you
might
trade
illegally
grow
relative
to
your
consumption
so
that
in
the
inner
city
if
youre
trading
something
for
five
dollars
thats
probably
not
a
great
percentage
of
what
youre
making
but
as
you
go
up
youre
in
the
suburbs
youre
in
the
upper
east
side
if
youre
involved
in
the
shadow
economy
some
pretty
serious
betting
or
some
financial
transactions
money
lending
et

1
over
42
years
as
a
public
school
educator
im
been
deeply
frustrated
by
the
way
that
some
districts
decided
to
exclude
many
inner
city
kids
by
creating
magnets
that
suburban
students
could
enter
via
admission
test
but
that
most
inner
city
kids
could
not
gain
access
to
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
many
african
americans
have
turned
to
charters
which
usually
are
open
to
all
kinds
of
students
1
to
me
this
is
a
very
important
issue
having
been
a
special
education
teacher
in
the
inner
city
i
know
that
there
are
many
children
that
fall
into
this
category
therefore
it
is
a
continuation
of
discriminating
against
poor
minority
children
that
have
the
capability
to
learn
but
need
more

this

i
listen

high

intoxicated
maybe
it
synchronizes
with
my
brainwaves
or
something1
technically
the
fact
that
he
was
intoxicated
means
it
was
rape
the
majority
of
states
have
laws
that
state
that
if
a
person
is
under
the
legal
age
for
sexual
consent
or
of
a
lowered
mental
capacity
or
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol
they
can
not
consent
to
sexual
activity
1
some
states
have
adopted
laws
counting
any
sexual
act
committed
on
a
female
while
she
is
intoxicated
as
rape
regardless
of
whether
she
gives
consent
while
the
law
is
specifically
gender
neutral
the
only
instances
that
it
has
been
applied
in

cases

the

destructive

a

freedom

the

become
intoxicated
at

the
problem
is
without
a
police
as
a
meaningless
abstraction
they
exist
because
at
some
point
in
time
a
blatant
seizure
of
property
was
considered
valid
and
then
all
possible
subsequent
identical
seizures
were
declared
invalid

rights

had
originally
seized

a
further
argument
proposed
against
the
validity
of

investigations
is
that
the
studies

have
been
done
by

who
profit
from

sales
are
subject
to
bias
due
to
a
conflict
of
interests
and
therefore
may
not
be
trustworthy

however
this
argument
can
be
classified
as
an
ad
hominem
circumstantial
argument
which
is
a
certain
stance
their
evidence
is
therefore
invalid
while
a
bias
may
be
cause
for
concern
it
is
unsubstantiated
to
conclude
that
the

just
such

was
laid
off

dedicated
performance

your
strengths

shows
that
you
were
a
valued
employee
writes
mr
kawasaki
this
is
especially
helpful
if
you
were
recently
laid
off
and
there
is
no
better
time
to
ask
for
this
than
when
your
manager
is
feeling
bad
because
she
laid
you

may

when

i
dont
buy
that
primarly
because
julie

so
far
placed
in

arguably
had
as
much
if
not
more
to
do

as
sinofsky
regardless
of
the
reason
why
steven

let

im
happy

the

are
shifting

you

at

be
only
a

we
can
hardly
tell
what
would
have
been
his

there
have
been
a
few
who
quite
independently
of
rewards
and
punishments
or
of
posthumous
reputation
or
any
other
influence
of

recently
he
felt
a

up
his

from

the

if
you
really

propose
the
incredibly
low
cost

any

these

up

it

you

you

or
whatever

youve

shoveled
down

throat
just
spend
a
few
moments
peeking
back
into
the
recent
past
when
a
local
mogul
with
a
napoleon
complex
was
busy
running
the
redskins
into
the
ground
a
grave
from
which
they
are
still
struggling
to
emerge1
but
latinos
are
equally
repelled
by
the
tea
party

antigovernment
screeds
that
emanate

corners

anyone
the
desire
to
cut
education

american
latinos
are
hardworking
lawabiding
and
mildly
socially
conservative
they
generally
dont
like
abortion
and
gay
marriage
but
dont
lose
their
lunch
over
it
but
they
are
overwhelmingly
workingclass
and
middlleclass
and
benefit
from
all
those
entitlements
that
republicans
have
been
screaming
about
so
much
these
past
four
years
their
cultural
and
social
traditions
do
not
posit
an
activist
government
or
a
government
that
regulates
large
swathes
of
the
economy
as
evil
and
oppressive
or
even
necessarily
wasteful
and
inefficient1
in
many
lowincome
countries
the
health
system
is
under
serious
stress
due
to
resource
constraints
causing
challenges
in
providing
good
quality
health
services
the
resource
constraints
have
a
substantial
influence
on
the
qualifications
of
health
workers
and
their
distribution
across
the
health
facilities1
more
generally
community
organizations
like

hope
have
played
an
important
role
in
helping
lowincome
and
minority
communities
weather
the
storm
of
the
past
few
years
besides
promoting
financial
literacy
and
providing
counseling
and
sometimes
credit
for
homebuyers
community
organizations
have
helped
build
small
businesses
through
investment
and
technical
assistance
1
the
imfc
also
agreed
that
the
imf
should
focus
its
work
on
lowincome
countries
on
sustainable
growth
backed
by
macroeconomic
reforms
that
support
the
achievement
of
the
important
millennium
development
goals
we
welcome
the
progress
that
has
been
made
on
debt
relief
and
once
again
i
congratulate
the
managing
director
of
the

and
the

for
moving
this

familes
with
kids
are
the
recipients
of
most
perceived
tax
giveaways
because
they
can
vote
yes
by
saying
they
did
it
for
the
children
a
huge
group
of
lowincome
families
do
not
stand
to
benefit
from
nonrefundable
credits
and
deduction
spiffs
because
their
income
tax
rate
deduction
already
pushes
them
into
the
standard
vs
itemized
posture
arguing
specifics
only
serves
to
garner
political
capital
rather
than
properly
shaping
tax
policy
for
the
country
1
but
i
think
we
have
some
unique
capabilities
that
could
be
even
more
effectively
explored
we
buy
a
lot
of
health
commodities
for
lowincome
communities
and
lowincome
countries
they
range
from
contraceptive
commodities
to
malaria
drugs
to
vaccines
for
children1
protecting
kids
from
seeing
too
much
however
is
something
thats
easier
to
do
if
youre
a
middleclass
or
highearning
sex
worker
for
many
lowincome
parents
trading
sex
may
mean
knowing
that
their
kids
will
grow
up
with
an
awareness
of
the
sex
industry
this
is
simply
reality
1
years
later
we
can
look
back
with
mixed
reaction
lowincome
housing
continues
to
lag
behind
the
need
as
it
does
everywhere
in
the
nation
the
countys
general

is
meant
to
address
some
of
this
problem
in
the
coming
years
1
have
you
ever
had
abusive
uneducated
parents
if
so
then
you
are
well
aware
of
the
inequity
in
pursuing
a
future
of
greatness
that
comes
of
being
born
into
a
lowincome
household
randianism
is
great
on
paper
but
in
real
life
not
great

people
who
want

without
the
need

upfront
the

offers
to
repay
loans
for
people
who
agree
to
work

lowincome

offers
up

lowerincome
and
minority
communities
are
often
disproportionately
affected
by
problems
in
the
national
economy
and
the
effects
of
the
housing
bust
have
followed
that
unfortunate
pattern
indeed
as
a
result
of
the
crisis
most
or
all
of
the
hardwon
gains
in
homeownership
made
by
lowincome
and
minority
communities
in
the
past
15
years
or
so
have
been
reversed1
although
you
certainly
wouldnt
want
to
belittle
the
very
real
issue
of
poverty
in
dcs
lowincome
black
neighborhoods
one
also
needs
to
acknowledge
that
there
are
some
very
large
and
distinct
wealthy
nonwhite
communities
in
the
suburbs
and
that
a
fair
percentage
of
gentrifiers
in
dc
are
actually
black
race
is
a
more
complicated
issue
than
ever
1
people
act
like
being
roofless
is
a
crime
but
what
the
hell
do
they
expect
you
to
do
just
crawl
in
a
ditch
ymca
has
a
very
good
program
for
subsidizing
lowincome

so
that
no
one
needs
to
forfeit
the
health
and
community
benefits
of
belonging
to
the
y
because
of
economic
hardship
admittedly
each
individual
ymca
gets
to
set
their
own
prices
and
discounts
etc
to
some
degree
but
you
can
use
a

at

we

increase

adjust

none
that
adequately
control

are

as
a
transit
planner
i
constantly
encounter
situations
where
something
has
been
built
in
a
way
that
precludes
quality
transit
where
little
differently
transit
would
have
been
possible
without
compromising
any
of
the
developments
other
goals
ive
also
dealt
with
situations
where
a
transitdependent
institution
say
a
socialservice
office
catering
to
lowincome
people
or
an
assisted
living
center
for
active
seniors
chose
to
locate
in
a
place
where
the
land
was
cheap
because
the
transport
options
were
terrible
and
then
blamed
the
transit
agency
for
not
running
buses
to
their
inaccessible
site
these
cases
are
the
result
of
a
poor
respect
and
understanding
of
transit
as
a
background
consideration
in
all
urban
development

we

know
its
hard
for
her
then
i
begin
to
feel
angry
at
her
too
for
sharing
that
bath
with
wendell
it
was
clever
though
it
makes
things
clear
but
at
least
she
doesnt
have
to
hear
us
i
say
we
dont
make
love
on
the
other
side
of
her
room
she
doesnt
have
to
listen
to
us
it
was
rude

do
that

paul
looks
at

looks
her
flush
in

that
soft
pink
swirl
of

suddenly

again
famished
he
wants
to
prepare
himself
another
sandwich
heavy
on
the
ham
and
settle
into
his
sleeping
chair
but
his
legs
wont
move
and
he
remembers
rather
too
suddenly
that
he
used
to
feel
this
same
way
after
making
love
to
his
wife
a
queer
shortlived
paralysis
which
overtook
him
as
he
lay
in
a

i
think
her
name
was
michelle
we
made
love
on
the
beach
on
the
edge
of
the
morrisons
watery
grave
it
was
her
first
time
she
said
and
afterward
i
made
a
hole
in
the
sand
with
my
bare
foot
and
buried
my
used
condommy
seed
my
potential
sons

daughters
sealed
in

coffin
earth
tapped
down
gently
over
them
with
the
palm
in
a
beach
towel
silent
and
full
of
regret
1
that
we
made
love
i
recognized
only
by
the
feeling
of
my
lower
body
a
wet
suctiony
joy
most
nights
i
would
have
curled
around
her
kissing
the
skin
between
her
shoulder
blades
my
low
arm
going
slowly
numb
beneath
her
1
her
face
was
the
kind
of
thing
one
sees
in
the
classical
wing
of
a
museum
beauty
as
a
force
of
history
her
robe
rode
up
the
back
we
might
make
love
that
was
what
my
great
quivering
cliche
of
a
body
had
in
mind
1
we
made
love
in
our
muggy
pension
room
lathered
one
another
in
the
shower
then
returned
to
the
plaza
to
feel
the
breeze
on
our
limbs
which
were
sore
in
secret
places
to
watch
the
stars
against
the
drape
of
night
and
browse
the

no
one
will
ever
know
why
or
when
but
it
could
have
happened
as
long
as
a
decade
before
she
discovered
the
disease
for
years
as
she
worked

made

mothered
her
children
the
malignant
cells
were
slowly
doubling
within

unstoppable
they
became

name
for
the
sandwich
before
michael
discovers
that
rita
is
mentally
challenged
we
see
her
in
front
of
a
wee
britain
sign
blocking
the
itin
britain
so
that
the
sign
reads
wee
brain1
religion
should
be
treated
as
a
mental
illness
because
really
you
have
to
be
mentally
challenged
to
be
an
adult
and
believe
in
make
believe
stuff
and
use
faith
rather
than
logic
believing
something
to
be
true
without
any
evidence
and
contrary
to
logic
is
crazy

when
sarah
goes
out
with
the
shotgun
that
night
shoots
in
the
air
and
falls
backwards
the
vagrant
doesnt
retreat
until
joe
steps
in
with
his
blunderbuss
meanwhile
cid
has
come
to
the
window
and
witnesses
this
its
a
pov
camera
i
could
be
wrong
since
joe
calls
him
a
retard
shortly
afterward
but
even
if
he
was
mentally
challenged
that
doesnt
mean
he
is
incapable
of
murdering
sarah
for
food
and
shelter1
glad
you
eschew
phrases
like
mentally
challenged
not
only
because
its
a
pc
euphemism
but
also
because
its
taken
on
an
ironic
meaning
that
can
be
intentionally
humorous
that
is
calling
someone
mentally
challenged
can
now
mean
hes
totally
ouf
of
his
mind
or
hes
merely
got
a
few
noticable
personality
problems1
for
those
who
want
to
insist
that
abuse
caused
this
uhh
no
it
did
not
she
is
the
youngest
of
three
children
she
has
been
extensively
psychoanalyzed
and
she
is
just
mentally
challenged
there
is
some
speculation
that
she
might
have
been
denied
oxygen
at
some
critical
formative
point
but
it
is
just
speculation1
he
was
evil
in
his

believed
this
to

5mil
others
including
mentally

the

used

always
thought
it
was
odd
that
we
got
the
tame
titles
in

odder
still
that
they
went
back
to
different
names
after
the
ps3
games
have
shared
the

titles
in

seems
like

controversial
in

have
sexual
innuendos

koenma

the

to
stop

all

sensui

hired

sent
him
on

sensui
knows
that
koenma
feels
extensively
guilty

if

one
thing
i
think
is
fascinating
about
the
rd180
powering
the
atlas
is
that
its
derived
from
the
rd170171
which
was
developed
for
the
zenit
rocket
used
in
various
configurations
to
boost
the
energia
also
used
in
an
analogous
role
to
the
srbs
in
the
us
shuttle
program
boosting
the
energiaburan
launch
stack
but
in
a
nutshell
you
have
a
very
effective
engine
design
that
was
originally
intended
to
oneup
the
us
and
to
launch
soviet
military
systems
like
the
polyus
which
was
intended
to
neutralize
the
strategic
advantage
of
the

sdi
and
now
its
powering

as

i
believe
the
entire
anecdote
was
manufactured
and
the

who
said
he

because
of
the
girl
was
a
convenient
way
to
neutralize
the
angry
elderly
black
man
who
is
wright
if
the
black
person
in
that
story
had
been
a
young
male
it
would
have
sounded
lewd
not
touching0
i
think
a
stronger
message
would
be
because
i
was
wrongmisled
i
will
fight
harder
than
anyone
to
correct
that
mistake
and
end
the
war
more
of
a
this
time
its
personal
tone
i
was
simply
suggesting
a
way
to
take
that
vote

make

i

logically

most

can

still
the

go
pale

i
mention
the

theres
something
to
be

wrapping
up

doing

that
would

today

the
cost
of
building

has
actually
fallen
in
the
last
10
years

monetary
terms1

dont
you
owe
it

work
really
hard
so
that
you
can
move
out

have

whats

harder

to

truly
dont
judge
her
for
being
overweight
but
i
judge
her
for
being
a
40
year
old
person
in
the
public
eye
who
overreacted
to
this
extent
did
i
really
just
hear
her
equate
the
private
email
she
received
about
her
weight
to
the
struggles
of
others
who
are
bullied
based
on
skin
color
or
sexuality
1
you
have
to
have
stopped
growing
for
one
thing
and
be
at
least
100
lbs
overweight
with
a
bmi
of
over
40
and
turbob
is
correct
you
need
to
find
a
bariatric
surgeon
and
speak
to
himher
1
i
totally
agree
that
there
are
many
cases
where
overweight
people
just
dont
have
the
selfdiscipline
to
do
what
it
takes
to
lose
the
weight
they
know
they
are
overweight
and
dont
need
it
pointed
out1
as
someone
who
struggles
with
their
weight
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
ive
always
been
very
skinny
i
find
people
amazing
at
what
they
feel
they
can
say
to
you
this
girl
obviously
knows
shes
overweight
she
doesnt
need
some
jackas
to
tell
her
people
come
in
all
shapes
and
sizes

as
humans
we
judge
its
in
our
nature
1
i
remember
the
doctor
with
my
mom
the
doctor
asked
the
quite
overweight
me
whether
i
knew
i
had
lost
10
pounds
my
mom
jumped
in
and
said
oh
we
dont
pay
attention
to
weight
shes
been
swimming
or
something
to
that
effect
1
balance
is
best
and
of
course
lots
of
enjoyable
exercise
is
essential
two
other
rarely
mentioned
factors
that
i
think
are
absolutely
a
part
of
being
overweight
too
much
stress
and
not
enough
sleep
the
truth
is
that
the
human
body
is

are

doing
this
you
have
a

prevailing
ideas
entertained
by
him

most
of
the
leading
statesmen
at

formation

were
that
the
enslavement
of
the
african
was
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
nature
that
it
was
wrong
in
principle
socially
morally
and
politically
it
was
an
evil
they
knew
not
well
how
to
deal
with
but
the
general
opinion
of
the
men
of
that
day
was
that
somehow
or
other
in
the
order
of
providence
the
institution
would
be
evanescent

pass
away

idea

not
incorporated

those

after

reminded
of

jesus
tells
us
that
those
who
perished
were
not
any
more
evil
than
those
who
did
not

they
also
would
perish
as
they
did

they

were
taught
to
respect
each
other

gall

is
the

myrrh
to
condemned
persons
to
help
to
alleviate
their
sufferings

so
disturb
their
intellect
that
they
might
not
be
sensible
of

the
rabbins
say
that
they
put
a
grain
of

out

he
as

never

it

itself
up

christmas
poem

three
daughters
entitled
an
account
of
a
visit
from
st
nicholas
moores
poem
which
he
was
initially
hesitant
to
publish
due
to
the
frivolous
nature
of
its
subject
is
largely
responsible
for
our
modern
image
of
santa
claus
as
a
right
jolly
old
elf
with
a
portly
figure
and
the
supernatural
ability
to
ascend
a
chimney
with
a
mere
nod
of
his
head
although
some
of
moores
imagery
was
probably
borrowed
from
other
sources
his
poem
helped
popularize
the
nowfamiliar
image
of
a

by
eight
flying
reindeer

everybody
has
heard
by
now
the
story
that
broke
in
the
early
hours
of
monday
night
in
ireland
two
weeks
ago
savita
halappanavar
died
of
septicemia
resulting
from
medical
complications
when
she
was
denied
pregnancy
termination
after
the
diagnosis
of
a
miscarriage
had
been
made1
what
sadistic
delight
is
inherent
in
ruining
the
life
of
a
young
girl
or
anyone
else
there
are
valid
reasons
for
terminating
a
pregnancy1
the
recent
availability
of
ultrasound
imaging
permits
early
diagnosis
of
cervical
ectopic
pregnancy
several
conservative
methods
for
pregnancy
termination
have
been
suggested
to
avoid
bleeding
preserve
the
uterus
and
maintain
fertility
currently
the
standard
treatment
of
cervical
ectopic
pregnancy
with
bleeding
includes
systemic
or
local
administration
of
methotrexate
mtx
with
or
without
additional
therapeutic
procedures
such
as
dilatation
and
curettage
followed
by
intracervical
balloon
blocking
uterine
artery
embolization
uae
or
ligation
or
even
cervicotomy

theres
no
difference
terminating
a
pregnancy
is
murder

sorry

its

i
dont
do
stuff
not
from
an
ideological
standpoint
but
because
it
needs
dusting
however
i
selfidentify
with
the
middle
class
because
around
50
of
my
friends
in
america
seemed
concerned
with
the
lack
of
the
accoutrements
in
our
old
and
obviously
preowned
home
approximately
another
50
thought
the
large
rooms
and
high
ceilings
were
a
waste
of
space
and
fuel
1
the
lie
you
see
was
not
completely
implausible
and
may
even
in
some
cases
have
been
not
entirely
unrelated
to
the
truth
todays
sellers
of
ford
preowned
vehicles
however
dont
bother
with
plausibility
even
to
this
limited
degree
they
tell
us
that
their
used
cars
were
not
just
preowned
but
preadored
preworshiped
and
prebabied
by
their
owners

right

its
not
about

its
about

we
must
remember
that
the
first
question
is
not
is
abortion
right
or
wrong
or
is
this
abortion
right
or
wrong
rather
the
first
question
is
why
do
christians
call
abortion
abortion
and
with
christians
think
that
abortion
is
a
morally
problematic
term
to
call
abortion
by
that
name
is
already
a
moral
achievement
the
reason
why
people
are
prochoice
rather
than
proabortion
is
that
nobody
really
wants
to
be
proabortion
the
use
of
choice
rather
than
abortion
is
an
attempt
at
a
linguistic
transformation
that
tries
to
avoid
the
reality
of
abortion
because
most
people
do
not
want
to
use
that
description
1
since
there
is
no
agreement
the
prochoice
position
not
a
belief
understands
reality
the
decision
to
give
birth
is
exclusively
a
womans
whether
or
not
it
is
legal
1
if
reducing
unwanted
pregnancy
was
a
goal
of
the
antichoice
religious
movement
they
would
get
out
of
the
way
and
allow
prochoice
organizations
to
do
their
jobs
instead
resources
are
wasted
that
ought
to
be

on

his

made
it
difficult
for
him
to
move

nomination
however
it
was

to
go
that
way
because
thats
what
the

wanted
him
to
do
in

i
dont

he
seriously
believed
in
either
side
1
arekushieru
ironically
ive
noticed
june
ve
noticed
that
it
is
also
the
strongest
prochoice
advocates
who
also
advocate
against
mutilating
babies
via
fgm
or
male
circumcision
they
dont
want
newborn
babies
harmed
in
any
way
but
have
no
qualms
about
them
being
poisoned
and
dismembered
only
a
few
weeks
younger
1
i
believe
he
is
ultimately
prochoice
but
has
severe
moral
qualms
about
it
just
as
i
do
he
originally
supported
roe
vs
wade
and
was
a
pretty
strong
advocate
for
it
but
over
the
years
he
also
began
to
see
some
pretty
bad
unintended
consequences
with
the
law
and
on
society
as
a
whole
1
here
you
see
a
young
minister
who
knew
how
to
cut
through
the
kind
of
prochoice
and
prolife
rhetoric
that
is
given
in
the
wider
society
she
preached
a
sermon
on
abortion
that
derives
directly
from
the
gospel1
everyone
is
prochoice
some
choose
to
protect
human
life
while
others
decide
to
destroy
it
while
probably
doing
a
standin
to
protect
trees
or
something
1
if
you
think
it
means
no
abortions
except
on
every
other
tuesday
then
thats
what
it
means
the
gop
doesnt
articulate
what
it
means
because
abortion
is
a
phony
political
issue
and
the
gop
is
prolife
simply
because
the
democrats
are
prochoice
abortion
policy
at
the
national
level
hasnt
changed
in
the
decades
that
the
gop
has
been
prolife
because
abortion
is
a
massive
fund
raising
issue
for
both
sides
1
you
can
be
prolife
and
prochoice
at
the
same
time
i
am
a
prime
example
of
this
belief1
prochoice
activists
on

the

to
scientifically
define
the
status
of

prochoice
recognizes

as
one
step
away
from
personhood
a
legal
definition
that
would
give
an
embryo
the
rights
of

the
reasons

about

has
not
been
authentic
is
because
the
church
has
not
lived
and
witnessed
as
a
community
in
a
way
that
challenges
the
fundamental
secular
presuppositions
of
both
the
prolife
side
and
the
prochoice
side
we
are
going
to
have
to
become
that
kind
of
community
if
our
witness
is
to
have
the
kind
of
integrity
that
it
must1
if
eastwood
goes
birther
or
starts
yelling
socialist
secretmuslim
in
the
next
few
days
i
will
withdraw
my
counsel
i
wonder
how
many
republicans
that
liberal
prochoice
same
sex
marriage
supporter
and
critic
of
the
wars
in
vietnam
afghanistan
and
iraq
and
that
he
has
had
more
affairs
and
extramarital
babies
than
bill
clinton
and
john
edwards
combined
1
i
actually
woke
up
this
morning
puzzling
this
over
how
does
the
republican
party
reach
out
to
the
people
theyve
disenfranchised
for
so
many
years
i
keep
hearing
republican
party
leaders
saying
this
but
in
order
to
do
so
theyd
have
to
give
up
their
entrenched
ideas
about
prochoice
taxing
the
wealthy
immigration
government
assistance
programs
and
so
on
so
i
dont
understand
what
theyre
talking
about
nor
do
i
see
it
being
achievable
at
all
the
only
way
this
can
happen
is
if
a
third
party
is
formed
out
of
the
shambles
of
this
republican
party
1
first
off
recently
factcheck
failed
when
they
stated
that
warren
was
wrong
in
stating
that
brown
is
a
supporter
of
abortion
rights
simply
because
he
stated
it
and
made
some
prochoice
votes
the
problem
is
that
it
fails
miserbly
to
mention
his
support
of
the
blunt
amendment
and
other
votes
that
were
decidingly
against
abortion
rights1
with
my
prochoice
views
on
abortion
up
thru
the
first
trimester
anyway
and
my
support
for
samesex
marriage
saddens
me
because
i
would
really
like
to
work
within
the
gop
to
advance
economic
freedom
limited
government
strong
national
defense
support
for
israel
rollback
of
islamism
etc
1
santorum
is
against
birth
control
but
he
never
said
it
should
be
outlawed
besides
no
one
in
their
right
mind
thinks
s
just
like
a
president
being
prolife
no
president
has
the
power
to
outlaw
abortions
1
erica
and
planned
parenthood
frame
the
issue
in
terms
of
womens
rights
when
the
heart
of
the
issue
is
the
rights
of
the
fetus
theres
no
reason
to
assume
that
because
someone
calls
themselves
prolife
that
they
are
automatically
on
the
wrong
side
of
all
issues
that
affect
women
im
prochoice
myself
but
i
dont
pretend
that
all
prolifers
hate
women
1
former
arkansas
gov
mike

insisted
in
an
exclusive
interview
with
newsmax
tv
that
gop
presidential
nominee
mitt
romney
will
be
a
prolife
president
and
he
also
predicted
that

will
step

president
clinton
birth
abortion
ban
was
signed
into
law
in
2003
the
legislative
effort
to
ban
partial
birth
abortions
had
a
very
positive
impact
increasing
prolife
support
in
the
united
states1
i
realize
that
i
can
be
snippy
myself
and
ive
soulsearched
my
webside
manner
i
ask
myself
abby
johnson
came
over
to
the
prolife
community
but
why
how
she
didnt
convert
because
of
prolife
arguments
she
converted
of
her
own
accord
based
on
her
own
reaction
to
a
series
of
events
1
unfortunately
the
abortion
issue
has
allowed
many
christians
and
conservatives
as
a
whole
to
claim
to
be
working
to
defend
the
most
vulnerable
when
in
fact
they
are
turning
attention
and
national
resources
away
from
those
who
are
most
desperately
in
need
the
good
that
actually
could
be
done
to
protect
life
isnt
done
because
prolife
christians
lend
their
support
to
politicians
who
are
most
likely
to
block
funding
for
programs
for
children
and
families
of
the
weakest
and
most
impoverished
the
abortion
issue
ends
up
serving
as
a
smokescreen
behind
which
certain
politicians
work
in
the
interests
of
those
who
are
the
most
rich
and
powerful
1
not
enough
certainly
and
some
of
the
most
prominent
catholics
whether
laymen
supported
abortion
rights
finally
i
think
many
prolife
people
are
politically
naive
and
are
too
willing
to
accept
empty
promises
to
say
that
nobody
stood
up
is
a
blatant
lie
though
1
when
i
first
started
blogging
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
was
very
insistent
that
the
antiabortion
movement
should
be
taken
at
its
word
when
it
came
to
rhetoric
about
saving
unborn
babies
from
being
murdered
i
insisted
that
the
prolife
movement
wasnt
antiwoman
or
antisex
and
that
those
who
opposed
abortion
genuinely
believed
that
a
zygoteembryofetus
was
a
person
with
rights
in
need
of
protection
just
like
any
other
person
i
believed
that
the
prolife
movements
actions
were
counterproductive
but
that
they
were
merely
misinformed
1
the
reality
is
that
socalled
prolife
movement
is
not
about
saving
babies
its
about
punishing
women
for
having
sex1
until
there
is
willingness
from
both
the
prochoice
and
the
prolife
movements
to
come
to
the
table
and
talk
withnot
ateach
other
the
abortion
issue
will
continue
to
rage
with
the
most
radical
from
both
extremes
controlling
the
largely
destructive
language
i
am
not
prochoice
because
i
think
abortion
is
a
great
or
desirable
option
but
because
it
is
a
deeply
personal
issue
that
i
dont
believe
is
anyones
business
beyond
those
involved
1
we
felt
the
right
to
life
has
but
there
does
come
a
time
when
policies
come
up
that
we
dont
normally
take
a
stand
on
however
networks
website
has
provided
no
sign
of
any
internal
debate
or
sensitivity
to
prolife
concerns
more
recently
though
the
group
posted
this
note
on
its
homepage
network
congratulates
the
us
house
of
representatives
for
passing
the
historic
healthcare
reform
legislation1
im
totally
prochoice
in
the
matter
of
abortion
but
of
course
im
also
so
radically
prolife
that
i
think
every
person
from
birth
onward
must
have
full
and
affordable
they
want
to
accept
the
candidates
credentials
in
the
case
of
minnesota
the
democrats
chose
not
to
sit
either
one
iirc
because
sitting
them
would
entail
swearing
them
in
with
the
oath
of
office
and
they
democrats
of
course
didnt
want
to
look
overly
partisan
and
they
thought
mistakenly
that
frankens
60th
vote
wouldnt
be
that
necessary
1
however
as
i
mature
and
grow
in
christ
i
am
coming
to
understand
how
false
of
an
idea
it
is
that
we
can
feel
like
we
are
prolife
simply
by
casting
a
vote
for
the
most
prolife
electable
candidate
i
definitely
should
be
doing
more
to
help
prevent
abortions
and
to
help
convince
women
to
give
up
their
children
for
adoption
1
when
we
finished
the
line
of
carnations
was
probably
a
mile
long
a
prolife
woman
let
me
hold
a
crucifix
that
she
had
i
started
clutching
it
close
to
my
heart
1
once
you
place
yourself
in
their
scientific
mindframe
you
read
the
fathers
differently
what
you
take
to
be
quotes
about
abortion
apply
equally
to
chemical
contraception
and
iudlike
methods
which
contrary
to
popular
prolife
belief
usually
not
alwaysoperate
by
altering
the
chemistry
in
the
womb
such
that
sperm
die
before
reaching
the
egg
1
be
prolife
and
be
consistent
but
stop
trying
to
proclaim
that
conservatives
and
the
right
wing
in
this
country
is
the
prolife
side
when
its
only
about
abortion
and
all
the
other
institutionalized
murder
committed
in
our
society
gets
a
free
pass
hell
it
seems
like
they
love
war
love
executing
people
guilty
or
not
and
love
the
idea
that
someone
without
insurance
would
die
1
i
will
never
ever
forget
what
happened
last
night
i
had
a
dream
that
night
that
they
all
converted
to
prolife
activists
i
hope
that
dream
becomes
a
reality

it
isnt
because
of
who
we
did
or
did

vote
for

we
havent
done
enough
it
isnt
because
we

is

terrible
terrible
sin

prolife
probirth

honestly

is

more

ive
always
had
the
belief
that
all
is

no

there
is
no

judge

belief

was

1
for
rightwingers
id
probably
meet
the
criteria
of
a
prochoice
person
because
i
respect
the
right
of
women
to
make
choices
about
their
bodies
however
i
am
also
a
person
who
respects
life
in
all
of
its
forms

so
i
could
also
qualify
as
a

the
policy
of
the

department
of

is
to
favor
voluntary
requests
if
you
are
in
a
psychiatric
hospital
want
to
leave
and
your
voluntary
request
has
been
accepted
you
can
try

upon
acceptance
of
your
application
by
a
community
agency
you
are
free
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
continue
the
services
1
this
has
been
true
for
people
with
both
voluntary
and
involuntary
status
you
may
believe
that
if
you
have
signed
yourself
voluntarily
into
a
psychiatric
hospital
you
can
sign
yourself
out
and
leave
when
you
decide
to
do
so
however
there
is
a
process
which
must
be
followed
in
order
to
leave
and
staff
can
try
to
keep
you
by
asking
the
court
to
commit
you
if

you

joe

has

as

delegate
because
a
long
time
ago
back
in

during

he
told
me
personally
how
important
samesex
rights
and
equality
were
for
him
he
looked
me
in

eye
and
took
my
hand
and
said

you

1
samesex
marriage
may
be
dominating
the
headlines
nationwide
but
political
candidates
stances
on
other
lgbtrelevant
issues
are
also
significantly
impacting
voters
decisions
as
november
gets
closer
according
to
a
new
survey
released
today
by
logo
tv
49
percent
of
the
general
population
would
also
be
more
likely
to
vote
for
a
candidate
if
he
or
she
supported
legislation
to
define
and
favor
a
political
official
who
would
continue
to
allow

1
dude
those
were
daveys
words
not
mine
i
think
samesex
marriage
helps
perpetuate
a
society
that
fails
to
consider
whats
best
for
its
children
burdens
taxpayers
with
the
consequences
of
irresponsible
sexual
behaviors
eg
unwanted
children
hivaids
and
allows
people
to
escape
their
responsibilities
to
the
children
that
they
create
1
so
for
instance
when
the
study
finds
that
children
who
have
had
a
parent
in
a
samesex
romantic
relationship
are
much
more
likely
to
suffer
from
depression
as
young
adults
than
the
children
who
come
from
ibfs
this
does
not
claim
that
the
gay
parent
was
the
cause
of
the
depression
in
his
or
her
child
simply
that
such
children
on
average
have
more
depression
for
reasons
unidentified
by
the
study1
despite
the
lack
of
empirical
evidence
for
the
claim
that
today
there
are
large
numbers
of
stable
twoparent
gay
households
for
the
last
ten
years
contemporary
gay
parenting
research
has
nevertheless
claimed
that
there
are
no
significant
differences
and
some
benefits
to
being
raised
by
samesex
parents
therefore
regnerus
analyzed
the

verify
this
claim

i
guess
why

funny
thing
about

so
despite
being
at

frontlines
sanitation

are
still
at
the
bottom
of
our
priorities

at
a
briefing
monday
mayor
michael
r
bloomberg
defended
his
decision
to
keep
most
of
the
city
government
open
for
business
on
monday
saying
thats
what
were
here
to
do
to
serve
new
yorkers
but
he
did
say
that
he
had
instructed
his
commissioners
to
use
their
judgment
to
determine
if
employees
who
were
not
involved
in
response
or
no
word
yet
on
tuesday
though
he
did
say
that
sanitation
workers
for
instance
would
be
on
12hour
shifts
to
pick
up
refuse
and
clear
storm
debris

the
caste
system
continues
to
reserve
sewer
and
sanitation
work
for
dalits
be
it
is
brihanmumbai
for
instance
around
30000
sanitation
workers
are
employed
by
the
greater
mumbai
municipal
corporation
and
all
30000
are
dalits
estimates
say
that
4060
of
the
six
million
households
of
dalit
subcastes
are
engaged
in
sanitation
work

in
two
weeks
democrats
will
gather
in
charlotte
nc
and
pledge
once
more
to
strengthen
the
right
of
workers
to
join
unions
and
negotiate
with
their
bosses
but
the
conventions
success
depends
on
the
work
of
the
citys
sanitation
workers
who
are
banned
by
law
from
exercising
that
right
as
the
party
readies
its
platform
pronouncements
those
workers
are
asking
for
more
concrete
help
1
when
i
asked
sunil
yadav
who
is
an
essential
worker
during
the
pandemic
what
had
changed
for
sanitation
workers
he
said
nothing
nobody
cares
here
in
mumbai
sanitation
workers
travel
three
to
four
hours
to
reach
their
working
place
nobody
arranged
transportation
for
us
as
they
did
for
the
doctors
and
other
medical
staff
1
this
case
has
raised
concerns
around
the
lives
of
the
sanitation
workers
during
the
pandemic
and
the
social
distance
of
class
and
caste
has
ensured
that
these
concerns
do
not
linger
for
long

sunil
yadav
a

and
a

fellow
from

said
everyday
sanitation
workers
get
exposed
to
deadly
trash
but
no
special
training
or
guidance
is
provided
to
them
on
how
to

the

public
safety
policies
that
clearly
dont
work
an
historic
increase

growing

and
above
all
and
perhaps
most
seriously
the
as
yet
unknown
wage
and
benefit
demands
of
public
employees
like
police
firemen
sanitation

teachers
and
the

i
believe
that
the

should
be
the
choice
of
the
retiree

not
of
the
detractors
of
his

or
her
tenure
in

an
employer
may
stop
showing
respect
for
the
contributions
of
a
senior

and
skirt
the
issue
of
age
discrimination
in
the
name
business
freedom
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
age
discrimination
is
a
form
of
ageism

he

estimating
the
population
size
of
fsw
in
the
different
countries
of
the
world
is
a
very
ambitious
reach
population
group
and
the
extent
to
which
sex
workers
can
be
reached
depends
on
the
countrys
legal
view
and
the
level
of
stigma
towards
sex
workers
the
number
of
fsw
also
changes
constantly
over
time
and
by
place
women
move
in
and
out
of
sex
work
according
to
their
financial
needs
they
migrate
from
rural
to
urban
settings
follow
seasonal
labourers
and
tourists
or
move
through
a
country
or
in
between
countries
along
highways
1
most
of
the
estimates
presented
are
probably
underestimates
the
data
obtained
through
surveillance
from
national
authorities
or
even
from
the
more
sophisticated
mapping
exercises
will
have
hidden
sex
workers
nevertheless
the
data
that
are
available
indicate
that
the
population
size
of
fsw
in
whatever
region
of
the
world
is
quite
important
1
syd
is
in
two
minds
about
whether
its
inherently
confusing
to
grow
up
with
a
sex
worker
as
a
parent
i
thought
my
mom
looked
pretty
like
youre
you
ive
clearly
done
a
lot
of
thinking
about
it
1
in
fact
all
the
sex
worker
parents
i
know
say
their
main
concern
is
not
how
their
children
will
handle
the
truth
but
how
the
rest
of
society
will
handle
it
after
all
its
ok
for
a
child
to
go
to
school
and
tell
everyone
that
her
dad
is
a
soldier
but
if
she
starts

thoughts
on
deciding
whether
or
not
to
tell
your
kids
youre
a
sex
worker1
so
how
are
sex
worker
parents
supposed
to
deal
with
this
lie
for
eighteen
years
and
hope
their
kids
dont
find
out
or
is
there
another
way1
in
many
countries
data
are
available
on
hiv
prevalence
among
sex
workers
however
in
estimating
national
hiv
prevalence
in
countries
with
concentrated
epidemics
the
lack
of
information
about
the
size
of
high
risk
populations
is
the
limiting
factor
in
producing
reasonable
estimates
of
the
national
hiv
prevalence
1
suspense
elements
begin
to
emerge
in
the
story
when
it
looks
like
the
pimp
could
get
out
of
jail
on
a
technicality
involving
an
expert
witness
and
then
heloise
faces
two
blackmail
threats
from
an
old
enemy
and
from
one
of
her
own
sex
workers1
i
cofounded
a
magazine
by
and
for
sex
workers
i
found
community
in
the
sex
worker
rights
movement
but
when
i
gave
birth
to
my
daughter
two
years
ago
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
should
shut
up
about
my
years
in
the
sex
industry
1
this
proportion
rose
to
11
of
sexually
active
ugandans
or
8
of
all
ugandan
adults
by

macro
international
1995
2001
however
these
low
figures
obscure
the
fact
that
condom
use
has
now
become
quite
high
among
those
people
who
need
them
most
namely
those
still
having
multiple
partners
in
the
2000
dhs
59
of
men
and
38
of
women
who
reported
having
a
nonregular
partner
said
they
had
used
a
condom
during
last
sex
with
such
partners
see

aha
sofia
the
muslim
terrorist
might
have
been
willing
to
unveil
and
dress
as
an
enslaved
sex
worker
but
she
wouldnt
violate
her
religion
by
getting
a
tattoo
then
eames
gives
a
selfsatisfied
smirk
like
she
knows
shit
about
anything
1
also
i
think
a
lot
of
the
commenters
are
missing
the
point
here
i
really
appreciated
that
the
author
gave
us
a
broad
spectrum
of
the
realities
of
being
a
parent
and
a
sex
worker
and
how
that
reality
is
often
complicated
i
didnt
feel
like
the
author
was
saying
this
was
a
great
situation
1
unwilling
to
give
up
and
still
haunted
by
the
fear
of
being
hiv
positive
i
turned
to
google
after
some
searching
i
discovered
that
the
health
department
offers
hiv
tests
for
sex
workers
anonymous
and
free
of
charge
deciding
that
this
was
better
than
nothing
i
went
to
the
health
department
pretty
scared
1
in
many
countries
the
hiv
epidemic
is
concentrated
in
subgroups
of
the
population
whose
behaviour
exposes
them
to
a
high
risk
of
acquiring
hiv
infection
these
subgroups
include
injecting
drug
users
men
who
have
sex
with
men
and
commercial
sex
workers
female
and
male
numerous
studies
have
documented
significantly
higher
rates
of
hiv
infection
in
women
involved
in
sex
work
when
compared
to
women
in
the
general
population
1
surveillance
of
hiv
infection
among
female
sex
workers
fsw
is
needed
not
only
for
monitoring
the
hiv
epidemic
but
also
to
provide
data
needed
for
the
planning
implementation
and
1
risk
compensation
is
the
notion
that
individuals
modify
their
behavior
in
response
to
real
or
perceived
changes
in
risks
pinkerton
has
defined
risk
compensation
as
any
behavioral
change
that
acts
to
offset
a
reduction
in
risk
resulting
from
other
changes
7
risk
homeostasis
theory
has
been
used
to
describe
this
phenomenon
8
accordingly
sexual
risk
compensation
in
the
context
of
mc
is
characterized
by
someone
knowing
that
they
are
less
likely
to
contract
hiv
and
responding
to
this
reduced
risk
by
increasing
behaviors
associated
with
greater
risk
of
hiv
transmission
such
as
not
using
condoms
increasing
the
number
sexual
partners
increasing
the
frequency
of
higherrisk
sex
eg
anal
sex
versus
vaginal
sex
or
increasing
the
frequency
of
sex
with
highrisk
partners
eg
sex
workers
have
been
used
interchangeably
in
the
public
health
literature
the
concept
of
sexual
risk
compensation
implies
that
a
change
in
potential
harm
has
occurred
and
is
in
turn
being
countered
by
a
change
in
ones
level
of
risk
behavior

sexuality
educator
cory
silverberg
author
of
the
childrens
book
what
makes
a
baby
doesnt
think
its
inherently
confusing
to
grow
up
with
a
parent
whos
a
sex
worker
its
confusing
for
adults
to
talk
to
a
kid
about
sex
work
because
our
associations
with
sexuality
are
so
complicated
but
very
young
children
dont
have
those
associations
yet
he
says
theres
a
way
to
talk
about
any
kind
of
sex
work
to
a
kid
you
might
say
mommy
spends
time
with
people
and
makes
them
feel
good
and
they
give
her
money
thats
more
than
that
most
parents
dont
tell
their
kids
details
about
their
jobs
especially
if
those
details
could
be
confusing
or
upsetting
1
in
conclusion
considering
that
hiv
epidemics
tend
to
be
concentrated
in
hardtoreach
subpopulations
such
as
fsw
more
efforts
should
be
made
by
governments
and
other
organisations
to
obtain
reliable
estimates
of
the
population
size
of
these
vulnerable
women
in
different
areas
of
their
country
the
wide
ranges
in
the
number
of
women
reporting
commercial
sex
work
is
certainly
related
women
themselves
in
defining
sex
work
but
also
by
the
temporal
variations
in
sex
work
the
various
levels
of
stigma
linked
to
sex
work
and
the
tendency
of
women
who
might
be
considered
commercial
sex
workers
to
be
a
hidden
population
the
approach
chosen
by

in
cambodia
may
be
a
good
example
for
other
countries

maybe
theyre
a
woman
or
a
person
with
disability
they
could
even
be
a
trans
person
or
a
sex
worker
the
point
is
theyre
trying
to
tell
you
they
know
better
than
you
about
their
issues
and
you
know
thats
just
plain
wrong

just
as

for

contact

not

there
are
a

of
people
who
sleep
around
the
only
difference
is
they
dont
get
paid
to

around

is

that
was
over
a
decade
and
some
ago
and
it
was
the
last
of
my
drinking
and
using
daysthats
what
i
had
been
reduced
to
it
took
several
years
of
being
sober
before
i
was
comfortable
with
camping
out
again
and
now
i
have
a
new
pack
and
lightweight
gear
that
allows
me
to
head
out

these

i
remember
the
simplicity
and
enjoy
it
though
im
glad
to
have
ny
van
and
family
and
job
and
home
and
and
when
before
all
i
had
was
a
pack
and
a
bottle
1
i
was
in
panama
last
year
and
was
amazed
at
how
many
old
guy
travelers
i
met
admittedly
they
were
sober
guys
in
aa
and
they
would
often
stay
on
other
aa
members
couches
most
were
expats
who
lived
on
just
social
security
and
crisscrossed
central
and
south
america
meeting
and
knowing
other
expats
in
all
the
different
countries
most
of
those
i
met
had
no
interest
coming
back
to
the
us1
heres
the
best
example
i
can
give
im
a
recovering
alcoholic
but
im
not
one
of

alcoholics
who
says
stuff
like
ive
been
sober

three

the
stuff

they
rather
choose

suspend
their
assent

focused

and
what
we
are
getting
into
there
i
suspect
is
the
correlation
with
having
the
latest
textbooks
and
a
small

size
the
reasons
are
interesting

well
having

is
a
prevalent
reason
to

failure
to
make

can
result

being
used
to
satisfy
only
basic
needs
for
structured

actually
can
operate

i
was
raising
money
in
houston
for
a
hospital
in
israel
and
when
i
was
over
in
israel
i
said
that
i
would
raise
money
for
them
because
it
was
a
childrens
hospital
and
they
wanted
to
build
a
its
a
regular
hospital
but
they
wanted
to
build
a
childrens
hospital
and
everybody
and
as
a
father
of
a
child
with
special

i
thought
it
was
really
worthwhile
but
theyve
changed

we

them

them

yes
shockingly
all

my

have
their

of

when

their

teacher
asked
how
i
felt
about
writing
in
no
homework
into
their

individual
learning

i
could
have
kissed
her1
and
for
that
reason
theres
a
special
person
who
comes
to
me
and
asks
for
a
puppy
its
someone
who
has
weighed
the
pros

has
decided
that

just
isnt

anytime
someone
mentions
the
need
to
address
the
special
needs
of
a
subgroup
you
should
be
skeptical
most
of
the
time
you
cant
divide
people
along
such
lineseven
if
in
specific
cases
the
distinction
appears
to
be
useful0
but
you
need
to
be
stout
or
scrawny
to
be
a
redneck
although
being
neither
doesnt
disqualify
you
the
scrawny
need
to
be
of
a
scrawny
type
that
used
to
be
called
wormylooking
and
the
stout
need
to
be
of
a
certain
porcine
aspect
thats
rarely
seen
in
this
country
outside
of
redneckery
but
thats
common
among
germans
and
russians
who
derive
from
stolid
peasant
stock1
dauphine
was
a
stout
woman
who
dressed
like
the
parttime
voodoo
mambo
that
she
was
skirts
her
personal
style
was
not
a
problem
in
this
part
of
the
world
where
voodoo
mambos
in
full
ceremonial
regalia
didnt
attract
one
whit
of
attention
1
and
there
are
good
physical
reasons
for
that
if
you
evolved
in
northern
climates
like
the
aleut
or
the
eskimo
populations
did
heat
retention
is
facilitated
by
being
short
and
stout
if
you
evolved
in
the
tropics
where
the
environment
is
very
hot
then
heat
loss
is
facilitated
by
being
long

lean

they
also
found
that
they

distinct
calls

the
type

what
the

looks

if
prairie
dogs
see
a
tall
thin
man
wearing
red

a
short
stout
man
wearing

the
calls
will
sound
different

even
develop
new
calls
when

come
across

objects

not

a
crucial
and
disturbing
story
this
morning
23

by
greg
miller
about
the
concerted
efforts
by
the

to
fully
institutionalize
to

permanent
the
most
extremist
powers
it

exercised

it
is
unclear
why
ahmad
aljabari
chose
to
travel
by
car
which
enabled
the
targeted
killing
since
he
was
known
to
take
strict
precautions
hamas
official
ghazi
hamad
said
aljabari
dedicated
his
life
to
resistance
against
the
occupation
which
he
endorsed
as
the
only
option
for
achieving
liberation
1
he
played
a
key
role
in
decisions
to
carry
out
controversial
strikes
including
the
predator
attacks
last

a
lawsuit
charging
senior
cia
and
military
officials
law
when
they
authorized
and
directed
drone
strikes
that
resulted
in
these
deaths
as
part
of
a
broader
practice
of
extrajudicial
targeted
killing
by
the
united
states
outside
the
context
of
armed
conflict1
in
the
first
six
months
of

verified
34
cases
of

these

armed

occupation

of
us
use

in

what

he
shows
that

argues
that

there
is
no

that

can
we
be
real
for

1
the
lack
of
outrage
or

over
the
institutionalization
of
a
kill
list
for
drone
operations
with
policies
that
include
dystopiansounding
mechanisms
like
a
disposition
matrix
has
largely
been
due
to
the
belief
in
the
individual
judgment
of
obama
it
may
be
unlawfully
or
illegitimately
used
however
democrats
and
obama
supporters
have
convinced
themselves
drone
program
is
not
likely
to
be
employed
improperly
by
obama
even
though
the
program
killed
a
sixteen
yearold
who
once
lived
in
denver
colorado
and
had
absolutely
no
involvement
in

background
on

development
of
a

program
during
obamas
first
term
go
here

then
there
is
the
question
of
authority
by
what
right
does
the
us
carry
out
targeted
killings
on
foreign
soil
even
if
the
host
country
grants
permission
does
it
possess
the
right
to
allow
other
nations
to
kill
its
citizens
or
as
in

case

its

for

how
you

mind
boggling
then
when
his
friends
pushed
everybody
to
its
breaking
point
and
he
could
no
longer
hide
the
fact
that
we
were
already
in
a
recession
anymore
without
losing
what
little
credibility
he
had
left
with
the
right
wing
he
urged
everybody
to
bail
them
out
with

money
they
lied
about

covered
up

then

solved
that
problem
by
refusing

anyone
that
engages
in
that
behavior1

of
the
breadth
of
the
problem
a

will
be
more
meaningful

theres
no
question
that
on
broadly
defined
social
issues
such
as
immigration
marriage
equality
and
drug
policy
barack
obama
has
been
terrible
hes
deported
record
numbers
of
immigrants
and
his
latecampaign
exemption
of
some
younger
undocumented
immigrants
was
one
of
the
most
cycnical
policy
changes
imaginable
yet
he
managed
to
increase
his
take
of
the
latino
vote
precisely
because
mitt
romney
and
the
republicans
are
even
worse
at
least
rhetorically
on
the
issue
1
sound
logic
certainly
but
without
lowlevel
criminal
offenders
or
even
undocumented
immigrants
that
have
committed
no
crime
can
be
arrested
and
unilaterally
deported
by
federal
authorities
without
much
of
a
criminal
justice
process
there
are
certain
appeals
and
removal
defense
tactics
that
undocumented
immigrants
can
be
denied
or
simply
not
told
about
when
the
secure
communities
program
is
utilized
1
state
immigration
laws
several
states
have
recently
passed
laws
that
forbid
what
the
government
deems
harboring
of
undocumented
immigrants
and
what
the
church
deems
christian
charity
and
pastoral
care
to
those
immigrants
perhaps
the
most
egregious
of
these
is
in
alabama
where
the
catholic
bishops
in
cooperation
with
the
episcopal
and
methodist
bishops
of
alabama
filed
suit
against
the
law
1
the
law
has
also
galvanized
the
growing
immigrants
rights
community
like
nothing
else
before
it
aside
from
undocumented
immigrants
the
american
citizens
who
make
up
what
i
call
the
21st
century
underground
railroad
of
supporters
people
like
julie
erfle
who
advocates
for
humane
immigration
policies
even
though
her
husband
a
cop
in
phoenix
was
killed
by
an
undocumented
immigrant
are
standing
up
and
speaking
out
the
case
before
the
high
court
may
be
titled
united
states
v
arizona
but
more
accurately
its
really
united
states
v
united
states
because
whats
at
stake
is
american
identity
itself
how
we
define
american
1
when
your
friends
and
family
have
these
limitations
and
can
not
leave
and
you
dont
want
to
leave
them
when
you
are
an
undocumented
immigrant
who
fears
being
identified
therefore
wont
seek
more
formalized
systems
for
support
or
shelter1
the
law
allows
police
to
detain
anyone
they
suspect
of
being

home
walking
around
the
countrys
first
immigration
station
was
a
deep
sobering
experience
it
was
a
reminder
of
why
immigration
must
remain
the
purview
of
the
federal
government
not
individual
states
like
arizona
and
alabama

its

it
still
makes
great

why
we
now
are

a
situation
where
we
have
10

in

the
vast

the

bill

a
slap
in

to
the
american

its

it
seems
both
the
democrats

republicans
want
the
american
people
to
accept
this
luncy
of
a
bill
that
allows
what
they
claim
an
estimated
12
million
so
called
undocumented
workers
when
in
reality
they
are
illegal
immigrants
into
this

the

reality
not
correct

by

this
has

my

he
was
a

shouldve
learned

only

my

gos
out
to
randys

the

horrible

will

you

take

you

outcome

turned

the

that
happened
prior
its
unfortunate
to
see
the
negative

coming
from
a
community
so
tightly
nit1
no
big
deal
if
a
few
fellow
humans
deserving
of
redemption
and
hope
go

we
only
live

all
the

we
can
smoke
for

purposes
of
course
so
glad
to
see
the
right
winger
neocons
go
down
1
that
wasnt
the
case
in
the
early
20th
century
however
in
the
1930s
after
the
release
of
the
hyperbolic
antimarijuana
film
reefer
madness
people
took
its
claims
that
smoking
weed
leads
to
killing
suicide
rape
and
general
insanity
seriously
because
most
had
no
idea
what
marijuana
was
to
reject
the
idea
that
it
could
cause
irrational
violence
or
moral
deviance
1
in
addition
to
the
aforementioned
i
say
that
we
legalize
weed
from
sea
to
shining
sea
wait
not
just
weed
but
acid
1
one
problem
is
that
to
those
of
us
outside
the
selfshaking
horseshit
snow
globe
smoking
weed
and
having
tattoos
arent
evidence
of
anything
most
of
us
look
at
all
the
charges
marshaled
against
martin
and
see
a
kid
1
gone
are
the
good
old
days
when
you
could
smack
the
snot
out
of
kids
and
they
had
to
respect
their
elders
at
your
age
maybe
you
could
just
smoke
a
little
weed
and
chill
all
the
references
to
hippies
demonstrates
not
only
a
lack
of
understanding
re
the
influence
of
main
stream
media
charactrizations
but
of
the
times
in
which
you
live
1
after
the
first
night
though
she
has
been
very
rude
to
me
making
fun
of
my
ptsd
screaming
at
me
for
asking
her
politely
what
she
was
going
to
do
about
her
dogs
flea
infestation
and
just
generally
snapping
at
me
any
not
possibly
stress
to
you
how
kind
considerate
and
warm
i
have
acted
towards
her
despite
her
childish
hostility
a
part
of
me
thought
that
since
some
girls
especially
the
young
ones
she
is
20
seven
years
younger
than
me
act
mean
toward
you
when
they
like
you
i
just
dismissed
it
as
sort
of
cute
aside
from
her
makig
fun
of
my
ptsd
from
past
sexual
abuse
and
calling
me
a
drug
addict
funny
since
i
only
smoke
weed
and
she
does
too
she
also
uses
pure
mdma
which
i
think
is
moronic
and
would
never
do
i
think
this
is
pretty
sociopathic
behavior
and
no
longer
cute
1
for
those
in
the
lets
band
guns
camp
theres
one
question
i
think
you
should
ask
yourself
do
bans
work
substances
are
kept
under
lock
and
key
or
are
in
a
safe
yet
youll
still
find
heroin
cocaine
weed
and
other
banned
drugs
readily
available
on
the
streets
what
makes
people
think
that
we
can
pass
a
gun
ban
law
and
all
the
guns
will
magically
disappear
1
im
twentyyearsold
a
little
late
to
the
show
with
psychedelics
but
have
entertained
the
idea
of
doing
them
for
a
long
time
in
part
because
of
my
interest
in
philosophy
altered
states
of
consciousness
and
the
fact
that
i
smoke
weed
regularly
which
i
think
has
opened
the
door
to
a
better
understanding
of
myself
and
my
relation
to
the
world
this
was
my
first
time
taking
any
psychedelics
and
i
took
them
two
days
ago

i
have
not
eaten
hog

years
and
am

another
indication
that
113088
is
viable
is
his
references
to
drinking
and
smoking
weed
he
did
not
do
either
by
the
early
90s
after
his
conversion
1
this
often
allowed
for
unusual
encounters
such
as
the
awardwinning
novelist
who
i
once
telephoned
from
a
hotel
lobby
as
his
attentions
were
diverted
by
a
prostitute
to
his
credit
he
did
the
interview
anyway
or
the
author
who
was
so
needlessly
nervous
that
he
showed
up
stinking
of
redolent
weed
i
said
nothing
but
was
happy
to
see
him
clean
up
his
act
years
later
or
the
guest
who
was
so
insecure
that
he
asked
me
to
feel
his
bicep
i
did
why
not
such
human
moments
allowed
me
to
care
more
about
the
authors
even
as
i
maintained
a
febrile
curiosity
and
did
my
best
to
ask
honest
questions
finessing
some
of
the
more
challenging
and
critical
queries
with
this
ethos
in
mind

i
think
youve

it
they
were
always
working

less
well
off
than
the
generation
above
them
the
inheritances
came
from
liquidating
the
houses
that
had
appreciated
significantly
over
time
in
expensive
markets1
shore
thing
is
obviously
someone
that
the
gop
targets
if
you
look
at
his
posts
he
has
tons
of
poor
grammar
and
spelling

is
apparently
well
off
enough
to
have
a
personal
generator

plenty
of

power
his

only
thought
is
that
he
is

wealthy
people1

the
concept
does
not

i

not

that
because
you
are
white

straight

that
you
are
privileged

that
you
are
very

even

off

all

nt

depended

he
eventually
became
fairly
well
off

then
later
lost
everything
again
never
even
got
to
high
school

alone
college
his
family
were
sharecroppers
in

when
his
father
became
too
sick
to
work

he
started
working
in

fields

put

on

dr

i
think
you
cant
start
too
early
my
5
year
old
daughter
already
knows
that
when
girls
get
older
they
start
having
blood
come
out
of
their
vagina
and
when
that
happens
they
can
have
babies
we
havent
had
the
birds
and
the
bees
talk
because
it
hasnt
come
up
yet

she
knows
about

hopefully
wouldnt
be
caught

i
used
to
watch

back
in
middle
school
yes
middle
school
and
i
watched
it
with
my
mother
of
all
people
its
basically
how
i
learned
about
the
birds
and
the
bees
and
everything
else
in
life
ironically
melrose
place
came
on
right
after
and
my
mother
would
immediately
tell
me
to
turn
the
channel

i
will
admit
that
it
took
me
a
while
to
warm
up
to
this
book
in
large
part
i
think
this
was
due
to
the
authors
narrative
style
and
in
particular
a
tendency
to
string
out
sentences
using
conjunctions
and
commas
rememeber
the
old
song
of
the
birds
and
the
bees
and
the
flowers
etc
well
this
type
of
sentence
seemed
to
dominate
the
early
sections
of
the
book
and
after
a
while
tended
to
grate
on
me0
one
of
the
ways
you
can
be
a
good
parent
to
your
child
is
teaching
him
or
her
about
the
birds
and
the
bees
a
lesson
your
ex
clearly
missed
out
on
he
doesnt
know
how
he
got
his
other
exgirlfriend
pregnant
heres
a
hint
for
him
the
same
way
he
got
her
pregnant
the
first
time
the
same
way
he
got
you
pregnant
and
heres
a
hint
for
you
dont
ever
let
it
happen
again
not
with
him

hi
im
rhoda
with
southern
hospitality
and
would
like
to
invite
you
to
check
out
my
holiday
tablescape
i
love
sharing
inexpensive
yet
impacting
ways
to
decorate
your
home
on
a
budget
while
not
sacrificing
style
and
beauty
i
just
moved
into
a
fixerupper
home
and
my
dining
room
is
going
to
be
one
of
those
fun
rooms
to
decorate
its
small
and
cozy
but
packs
a
lot
of
punch
i
used
some
linens
i1
and
as
cozy
as
our
life
is
reaching
for
the
extraordinary
can
be
pretty
damn
uncomfortable
so
i
guess
the
way
i
feel
is
about
right0
and
while
her
designs
range
from
stunningly
simple
to
classically
cozy
you
are
ensured
to
find
a
piece
you
love
simply
by
browsing
her
collection
in
fact
as
soon
as
i
spotted
her
handmade
pearl
hoops
i
was
completely
smitten
and
when
she
offered
to
give
a
pair
to
one
of
my
lucky
readers
i
was
just
giddy
because
i
know
you
will
look
absolutely
fabulous
this
holiday
season
in
these
one
of
a
kind
earrings
that
will
make
you
the
star
of
any
event0
oh
man
i
could
use
this
in
practically
every
room
in
my
house
we
are
a
family
of
4
living
in
a
one
and
a
half
bedroom
duplex
so
its
definitely
cozy
we
need
all
the
storage
solutions
we
can
get
haha1
for
the
knitters
in
the
area
blazing
needles
1365
south
1100
east
is
the
best
game
in
town
with
a
cozy
homelike
atmosphere
and
a
great
selection
of
yarns
and
classes
to
suit
all
crafters
you
cant
go
wrong
plus
theres
free
begining
knitting
on
saturday
mornings0
in
conclusion
my
number
one
decorating
tip
is
just
to
decorate
with
stuff
that
reminds
you
of
the
things
you
love
objects
that
make
you
feel
cozy
at
home
and
like
yourself
oh
and
abuse
the
shit
out
of
butcm
on
man
have
some
fun0
despite
giving
the
hannah
montana
star
a
sparkling
neil
lane
engagement
ring
in
june
it
seems
that
the
aussie
actor
may
not
be
quite
ready
to
settle
down
just
yet
as
he
was
spotted
getting
very
cozy
with
a
hot
blonde
at
a
hollywood
party
last
week
and
radaronlinecom
has
the
exclusive
details1
the
stuy
town
starbucks
on
first
ave
is
not
very
cozy
and
the
music
in
the
morning
is
too
loud
and
uptempo
gently
awaken
the
souls
off
to
work0
critics
say
straus
who
became
speaker
in
2009
and
is
running
for
a
third
term
in
that
position
has
been
too
cozy
with
democrats
and
hasnt
been
conservative
enough
on
hotbutton
issues
like
abortion
taxes
government
spending
and
illegal
immigration0
then
black
rioters
took
to
the
streets
and
showed
their
anger
by
destroying
their
own
neighborhoods
instead
of
showing
their
anger
towards
the
cause
of
their
anger
to
begin
with
which
was
the
los
angels
police
department
which
did
no
good
at
all
their
homes
were
destroyed
people
were
harmed
or
killed
and
to
what
end
the
police
department
was
fine
and
not
harmed
at
all
the
police
officers
were
safe
and
cozy
in
their
homes
or
their
police
cars0
other
photos
on
richardsons
blog
reveal
his
closeness
with
gaga
snapshots
of
the
pair
riding
soul
cycle
bikes
goofing
around
backstage
or
cozying
up
in
a
hotel
room
after
one
of
her
concerts1
there
is
nothing
quite
like
cozying
up
next
to
the
fireplace
in
the
winter
your
gas
fireplace
however
can
leave
unsightly
soot
marks
on
your
living
room
walls
soot
is
a
fine
brown
or
black
powder
that
is
the
result
of
than
just
water
to
remove
you
must
properly
clean
soot
from
your
walls
so
you
do
not
damage
them0
my
first
impression
walking
in
was
damn
it
sure
it
cozy
in
here
and
then
i
noticed
all
of
the
couches
and
each
set
of
couches
was
facing
a
tv
then
after
we
got
all
comfy
on
the
couches
i
noticed
that
each
section
had
their
own
remote
so
we
are
free
to
watch
whatever
wed
like
d
there
are
also
games
there
so
you
can
play
those
or
just
sit
down
and
relax1
ordered
workers
showing
up

other

cozy

to

this
is
like
the
tour
around
the
house
of
a
dream
of
any
other
person
looks
so
lovely
cozy
and
bright
this
is
just
amazing
i
would
like
to
decorate
my
apartment
in
a
similar
style
thank
you
for
such
great
ideas0
the
pair
who
met
on
the
set
of
the
first
twilight
film
in
2008
never
publicly
addressed
their
relationship
until
stewart
issued
a
public
statement
apologizing
to
pattinson
for
her
momentary
indiscretion
after
photos
were
released
of
her
getting
cozy
with
her

obama
came
into
power
with
the
intention
of
deescalating
the
conflict
with
venezuela
after
all
the
bushies
had
tried
to
overthrow
chavez
who
naturally
had
some
good
reasons
to
hold
a
grudge
but
chavezs
cozying
up
with
iran
was
the
dealbreaker
for
the
riskaverse
obama
he
was
unwilling
to
take
the
inevitable
heat
from
the
lobby
and
its
friends
in
congress0
living
rooms
with
vaulted
ceilings
which
are
typically
larger
rooms
overall
are
pleasantly
spacious
however
they
can
pose
interior
design
issues
when
trying
to
make
the
room
feel
cozy
and
inviting
you
can
fill
large
open
spaces
and
high
walls
with
color
the
right
furniture
and
lighting
that
will
make
your
vaulted

living
room
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
and
stylish
rooms
in
your
home0
me
and
my
fianc
spent
five
nights
in
the
spacious
and
cozy
room

on
the
ground
floor
we
booked
and
paid
our
room
well
in
advance
the
checkin
went
smooth
the
staff
was
kind
and
helpful
however
not
all
of
them
spoke
proper
english0
read
every
word
and
go
over
ads
and
descriptions
with
a
finetoothed
comb
almost
more
important
than
what
is
said
look
for
what
the
descriptions
leave
out
look
for
things
like
sufficient
bathrooms
and
beds
to
meet
your
requirements
be
on
the
lookout
for
red
flag
words
like
cozy
meaning
too
small
or
quaint
meaning
poorly
taken
care
cleaning
facilities
and
entry
to
the
beach1
a
round
bed
that
takes
up
the
entire
room
how
cozy1
theres
a
ramp
out
front
for
accessibility
and
a
picnic
bench
in
their
yard
beneath
glorious
orange
red
and
yellow

this
lovely
old
structure
is
not
atypical
for

over
100
years
ago

granite
from
a
local
quarry

quite
cozy

ive
always
loved
house
shows
concerts
i
think
its
the
best
way
to
hear
an
artist
perform
i
like
the
idea
of
performers
playing
in
one
room
and
in
another
we
have
the
kitchen
where
people
are
making
food
hanson
said0
the
room
is
cozy
and
the
tables
are
close
together
we
were
wedged
between
a
group
of
six
that
had
just
arrived
from
manhattan
and
were
clearly
sniffing
something
during
the
drive
they
were
looking
to
refuel
before
hitting
the
clubs
that
night
the
guys
decided
to
pass
on
food
altogether
and
just
drink
at
the
bar

their

ate
alone

one
of
the
messages

that

revolves
around
capriciousness

dr

people
in
the
most

group
could
expect
to
live
28
years
longer
than
people
in
the
most

group
758
versus
73
years
by

the
difference
in

expectancy
had
increased
to
45
years
792
versus
747
years
and
it
continues
to
grow
he
said1
after
20
years
the
lowest
socioeconomic
group
lagged
further
behind
the
most
affluent
dr
singh
said
noting
that
life
expectancy
was
higher
for
the
most
affluent
in
1980
than
for
the
most
deprived
group
in
20001
of
course
in
todays
society
that
will
be
seen
as
politically
incorrect
and
establish
a
whole
new
segment
of
social
victims
those
poor
nonvoters
they
just
had
a
deprived
upbringing
they
are
mostly
minorities
so
this
must
be
racist
if
only
we
established
better
educational
opportunities
for
them
etc
the
poor
will
always
be
with
us
however
its
also
true
that
you
cant
make
a
poor
man
rich
by
making

rich
man
poor1

i
am

honest
hardworking
smart
people
in
place0

check
down
there
cuz
sometime
she
does
nt
wipe
very
well
and
can
get
red1
to
be
fair
to
my
husband
he
was
the
one
doing
most
of
the
running
around
and
rushing
down
to
the
hospital
when
his
mom
would
get
hospitalized
he
would
take
off
from
work
to
get
down
there
and
id
meet
him
there
after
work
in
fact
i
did
not
visit
her
yesterday
because
i
just
didnt
feel
up
to
it
and
i
figured
it
was
better
to
not
spread
my
germs
anyway0
ralph
waited
a
few
minutes
what
are
you
doing
down
there
mahailey
he
fumed
i
could
have
emptied
the
whole
cellar
by
this
time
i
suppose
ill
have
to
do
it
myself0
she
acted
shocked
husband
why
i
didnt
shave
down
there
and
that
the
ob
had
to
trim
some
hair
down
there
waa
labored
on
my
own
until
i
had
urge
to
push
they
tied
to
coach
me
to
push
back
to
back
and
no
breathing
but
i
told
them
im
not
pushing
when
i
dont
have
a
contraction1
paige
agreed
you
have
some
pride
when
your
husbands
down
there
and
your
father
there
it
does
make
you
feel
proud
and
it
is
something
to
be
proud
of
i
think
to
come
together
problem
solve
and
make
it
work
i
love
that0
omg
i
love
my
dad
more
than
anything
but
if
wed
been
in
a
situation
where
he
had
to
deliver
my
baby
i
wouldve
been
nothing
short
of
absolutely
mortified
in
the
emts
to
arrive
out
of
total
humiliation
of
the
idea
of
letting
him
look
well
down
there
yikes1
russkii

explain
to
me
you
are
attracted
to

them
a
drink
chat
them
up
a
while
wow
sparks
are
flying
you

the
parts

are
interested
in
yknow
down
there
what
changes
when
you
learn
about
something
they
used
to
have1
he
really
loved
to
see
that
charles
jr
said
this
would
have
been
the
highlight
of
his
life
if
he
had
made
it
down
there
for
that
missouri
game
weekend
we
want
to
continue
on
with
his
legacy
and
come
down
there
in
future
years
0
that
memory
of
the
launch
is
a
powerful
one
for
me
even
today
all
these
years
later
i
asked
my
dad
years
later
what
motivated
him
and
mom
to
pack
the
whole
family
up
into
that
rv
and
take
us
down
there
he
replied
that
it
was
something
he
thought
we
should
all
see
it
was
something
you
get
a
chance
to
see
very
often0

my
idiot
nephews
just
so
you
know
survived
only
because
they
were
hiding
in
the
secret
passage
underneath
the
strategically
important
fountain
when
the
explosions
went
off
they
were
smoking
cigarettes
and
looking
at
girly
magazines
as
it
turns
out
i
survived
only
because
i
was
down
there
too
yelling
at
them
to
get
back
to
work
giving
away
hot
dogs0
lots
of
great
juke
joints
there
and
be
sure
and
grab
some
q
pulled
pork
or
ribs
while
youre
down
there0
tammy
thats
just
so
gross
why
would
anyone
want
to
have
that
me
maybe
his
wife
likes
it
tammy
shaking
her
head
that
wouldnt
do
anything
down
there
me
how
do
you
know
have
tammy
ewwww
no
me
so
you
dont
know
maybe
i
need
to
grow
mine
out
like
that1
if
i
had
a

id
buy
every
book
on
selfesteem
i
could
prior
to
her
becoming
hormonal
and
i
her
self
image
prior
to
and
during
her
teen
years
i
think
this
goes
hand
in
hand
with
how
girls
act
out
sexually
at
a
young
age
when
they
first
discover
something
down
there1
with
the
boys
it
was
more
like
12
years
old
when
they
wondered
what
was
happening
to
them
down
there1
soul
mate
i
see
you
down
there
waiting

be

youd
be
a

i
think
politicos

a

i
admit
thats
about

ive
been
in

in
many
a
day
when
i
looked
down

saw
a

who
looked
a

like
pauline
kael

turned
out
to
be

was

by

conflict
with

one
comment
i
am
amazed
at
the
hiring
and
promotion
practices
of
some

these
practices
particularily
in
areas
that
require
some
skilltalent
are
of
major
importance
to

firms
well
being
yet
i
see
time
and
again
extremely
qualified
people
being
downsized
often
the
wrong
ones
then
taking
a
very
long
time
to
be
hired
and
then
being
underemployed
employees
often
have
high
transaction
costs
too
sometimes
almost
insurmountable
to
make
a
change
to
a
different
employer1
common
complaints
include
improper
billing
practices
which
led
to
a
class
action
settlement
in
2004
and
poor
customer
service
following
the
closing
of
domestic
call
centers
in
2006
the
better
business
bureau
issued
a
warning
to
charter
in
2007
for
bankruptcy
and
was
forced
to
cut
cost
and
downsize

in
my
career
taking
personal
responsibility
means
lowering
my
expectations
from
my
job
making
the
most
of
what
ive
got
and
just
being
grateful
for
it
and
then
finally
lowering
my
downsizing
doing
whatever
it
takes
to
not
just
survive
but
somehow
save
money
and
keep
thriving
during
all
these
changes0
how
many
people
do
you
know
that
actually
do
the
things
they
say
they
are
going
to
when
they
reach
arbitrary
ages
of
leaving

they
the

executed

theyre
already
losing

a
full

this
is
the

expect

a
feeble

that
simply
wont
work
just
like
nothing
else
theyve
done
has
worked1
but
i
digress
the
course
of
events
that
i
meant
to
reference
time
for
change
has
arrived
and
we
must
do
some
personal
downsizing0
theres
nothing
like
a
factfree
rant
to
stir
up
the
terminally
aggrieved
country
class
a
ruling

made
up
of
nonprofit

it

a

there
although
i
think
some
people
who

during

phase
may
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
have
a
drinking
problem1
its
much
the
same
in
the
chemical
dependency
world
where
its
a
basic
professional
tenet
that
denying
that
you
have
a
drinking
problem
is
one
of
the
strongest
signals
that
you
have
a
horrid
drinking
problem
once
you
enter
into
the
clutches
of
the
kind
of
people
who
can
defend
such
logic
you
can
never

ladies
and

after
completing
extensive
research
over
the
past
few
years
i
am
finally
confident
in
presenting
you
with
some
tips
and
suggestions
for
living
life
as
a
modern
day
young
adult
after
reading
this
article
you
will
learn
how
to
perfect
the
concept
of
friends
with
benefits
some
say
its
easy
while
others
claim
it
to
be
hard
but
if
you
take
my
advice
with
utmost
consideration
you
will
be
one
of
the
most
popular
kids
on
your
college
campus1
by
not
surrounding
yourself
with
your
friend
for
the
majority
of
the
week
it
will
allow
for
the
lack
of
feelings
to
develop
further
friends
with
benefits
are
ideal
for
busy
college
students
and
young
adults
entering
a
career
those
with
a
high
sexual
drive
and
too
much
going
on
i
have
heard
of
a
few
accounts
of
elderly
individuals
who
prefer
this
type
of
relationship
and
lifestyle
but
my
first
phase
in
investigative
reporting
starts
next
week
regarding
this
age
group1
another
rule
to
consider
involves
etiquette
when
out
together
in
public
it
is
acceptable
to
treat
your
friend
to
a
drink
it
is
not
acceptable
to
treat
them
to
dinner
or
lunch
again
although
this
may
seem
petty
it
crosses
the
fine
line
between
friends
with
benefits
and
a
committed
relationship
and
leads
to
your
friend
gaining
a
few
pounds
lets
keep
the
goal
in
mind
people1
the
biggest
issue
with
this
type
of
relationship
is
the
heavy
presence
of
emotions
and
if
you
cant
go
a
few
days
without
seeing
this
person
and
want
to
move
forward
just
say
so
in
a
way
being
friends
with
benefits
is
often
a
perfectly
healthy
transition
from
friendship
to
committed
relationship1
all
joking
aside
the
best
component
of
any
relationship
whether
friends
friends
with
benefits
committed
relationships
or
even
polygamy
is
the
component
of
honesty
and
trust1
general
comment
to
me
this
songs
shows
me
of
a
time
when
someone
would
have
a
friends
with
benefits
kind
of
thing
but
both
would
always
want
a
relationship
but
they
never
want
to
ruin
what
the
have
so
they
stop
everything
its
over
before
they
met1
youre
asking
your
male
friends
to
provide
some
degree
of
physicalsexual
comfort
that
should
take
place
in
a
dating
relationshipmarriage
friends
with

or1
a
flirtationship
much
like
a
friends
with
benefits
situation
means
having
all
the
benefits
of
a
relationship
without
the
obligations
you
dont
feel
obligated
to
spend
money
on
date
after
date
or
have
the
awkward
meettheparents
dinner
to
please
your
partner
in

you
can
save
your
weekend
nights
for
clubbing
with
the
girls
and
splurge
on
those

you
just
hadto
have
about
the
author1
be
upfront
with
your
relationship
expectations
to
a
woman
youre
seeing
tell
her
exactly
what
youre
looking
for
when
the
time
is
right
that
could
be
youre
still
figuring
it
out
friends
with
benefits
open
dating
or
an
exclusive
relationship1
on
the
second
exam
which
covered
a
section
on
pornography
a
section
on
kant
on
lying
and
a
section
on
friends
with
benefits
relationships
there
were
15
questions
three
of
these
questions
were
about
the
act
of
ejaculating
on
a
womans
face
in
pornography
one
of
the
questions
was
about
kant
i
had
a
female
student
come
up
to
me
while
i
was
proctoring
the
exam
to
clarify
what
the
professor
meant
in
a
question
asking
how
ejaculation
functions
differently
in
straight
porn
and
in
gay
porn1
thats
not
marriage
its
friends
with
benefits
and
the
occasional
booty
call
if
you
cant
live
with
a
person
why
not
move
on
and
find
someone
with
whom
you
can
and
its
bs
and
a
damn
lie
that
its
popular
among
baby
boomers1
im
actually
involved
with
three
men
and
all
three
of
them
know
about
each
other
its
evolved
past
the
friends
with
benefits
definition
into
something
more
meaningful
with
all
three
i
wont
go
into
specifics
because
they
are
dear
to
me
but
everybody
is
aware
and
willing
to
explore
it
for
what
it
is
something
undefined1
will
my
friends
with
benefits
ever
become
something
morewe
used
to
date
but
he
says
he
doesnt
want
to
see
anyone
romantically
could
he
want
me
later
on
if
i
continue
being
friends
with
benefits
and
play
it
cool1
i
am
feeling
good
i
had
dinner
with
llcd
and
his
sister
and
her
husband
this
was
the
4th
time
we
kissed
when
he
drove
me
home
after
i
said
to
him
i
feel
attracted
to
you
it
would
feel
great
to
date
and
get
to
know
each
other
better
i
dont
want
to
have
a
friends
with
benefits
relationship
he
agreed
with
me
that
he
doesnt
want
fwb
and
wants
to
date
and
that
he
likes
me
too
its
really
exciting1
another
idea
was
for
the
episode
featuring
phoebes
wedding
to
confirm
that
she
and
joey
had
had
a
friends
with
benefits
relationship
for
years
before
she
met
mike
the
actors
liked
the
idea
of
this
but
it
was
scrapped1
glanville
meanwhile
is
single
but
enjoying
a
friends
with
benefits
arrangement
with
an
unnamed
los
angeles
businessman1
because
when
people
ask
if
youre
just
friends
theyre
asking
if
theres
anything
more
than
just
a
friendship
what
youre
talking
about
is
friends
with
benefits
basically
those
benefits
mean
its
not
just
a
friendship1
this
isnt
a
negative
nobodys
saying
the
relationship
is
any
less
valuable
or
strong
as
a
result
of
this
its
not
bad
or
something
but
if
youre
having
sex
youre
not
just
friends
youre
friends
with
benefits1
from
my
experince
friends
with
benefits
is
just
sex
without
having
to
pay
a
prostitute
either
male
or
female1
general
comment
its
about
a
friends
with
benefits
relationship
a
guy
and
girl
who
are
friends
are
out
one
night
and
get
drunk
they
end
up
hooking
up
and
doing
the
deed
this
ends
up
happening
a
couple
of
times
the
girl
blames
it
on
her
being
drunk
though
the
guy
thinks
it
otherwise
you
know
what
you
did1
thats
when
i
knew
i
had
to
get
clean
hmiel
says
now
that
fight
was
the
stupidest
thing
youve
ever
seen
but
im
so
thankful
it
happened
that
was
the
moment
that
turned
my
life
around1
claude

to
the
officers
bath
a
shed
with
big
tin
tubs
and
carried
away
their
uniforms
to
dry
them
in
the
kitchen
it
would
be
an
hour
before
the
officers
would
be
about
he
said
and
in
the
meantime
he
would
manage
to
get
clean
shirts
and
socks
for
them0

all
you
are
doing
is
enabling

all
you
are
doing
is
giving
an
addict
money
for
his
fix
because
you
dont
want
to
deal
with
the
consequences
you
have
to
go
through

are

at

a

but
you
can
not
just
get
clean

sober

expect
it

to
fall

if

had
thought
about
it
so
long
id
decided
s
i
knew
it
was
going
to
happen
getting
clean1
in
december
2012
verso
books
will
publish
his
the
poorer
nations
a
possible
history
of
the
global
south
which
former
un
secretary
general
boutros
boutrosghali
calls
a
contribution
to
the
emancipation
of
developing
countries
and
their
empowerment
through
greater
selfreliance
on
their
own
intellectual
and
analytical
resources1
all
of
these
initiatives
are
based
on
carbon
offsetting
essentially
permission
slips
purchased
by
corporations
and
governments
to
allow
them
to
continue
dumping
co2
into
the
atmosphere
in
exchange
for
the
ecosystem
service
provided
by
forests
and
agricultural
soils
in
the
global
south
which
act
as
carbon
sinks0
social
movements
in
the
global
south
do
not
mince
words
the
invitation
for
the
peoples
summit
in
rio
declared
nothing
in
the
green
economy
questions
the
current
economy
based
in
extraction
and
fossil
fuels
nor
the
patterns
of
consumption
and
industrial
production
but
extends
this
economy
into
new
areas
feeding
the
myth
that
economic
growth
can
be
infinite1
what
is
especially
offensive
about
this
new
green
economy
is
that
it
removes
from
the
table
all
of
the
positive
lifeaffirming
approaches
that
the
social
movements
of
the
global
south
have
been
nurturing
for
decades1
this
new
movement
portrayed
by
the
media
as
students
and
anarchists
from
the
rich
and
prosperous
global
north
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
in
the
global
south
a
far
deeper
and
wideranging
movement
has
been
developing
for
years
largely
ignored
by
the
media1
i
learned
to
play
baseball
taught
by
the
same
gym
teacher
who
instructed
us
in
the
proper
use
of
our
gluteus
maximus
we
all
shook
in
delightful
terror
at
principal
birchs
lunchroom
birthday
paddle
as
she
sang
out
your
years1
eventually
if
he
wants
to
go
all
the
way
then
both
will
have
to
grow
into
that
position
for
now
though
they
should
simply
celebrate
his
honesty
and
the
fact
hes
not
wearing
a
proverbial
noose
around
his
neck
anymore
because
that
is
what
living
with
such
a
secret
makes
someone
feel
like0
what
a
bunch
of
crap
you
all
must
live
in
another
universe
everyone
knows
the
earth
is
flat
and
if
you
are
hindu
you
also
know
it
is
balanced
on
top
of
an
elephant
which
is
standing
on
turtles
what
are
they
standing
on
turtles
go
all
the
way
down
stupid0
you
started
off
so
good
and
then
stepped
out
into
loony
land
by
saying
the
market
should
regulate
itself
maybe
we
should
go
all
the
way
and
have
the
industry
regulate
prescription
drugs
too
boy
i
bet
that
would
really
workout
good
for
all
us
citizens0
well
thats
certainly
much
better
thank
you
for
finally
listening
and
not
making
that
stupid
amount
of
different
versions
however
why
not
go
all
the
way
and
only
make
one
version
that
would
really
simplify
things
but
then
again
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
have
that
overpriced
pro
edition0
as
jeffs
blog
shows
ids
has
known
all
this
for
quite
some
time
even
without
an
rct
i
am
sure
that
its
communications
and
outreach
staff
knew
what
they
were
doing
all
of
these
lessons
are
also
key
components
of
odis
research
communication
workshops
which
go
all
the
way
back
to
2009
and
the
communications
team
there
have
had
how
to
guides
for
much
longer
that
say
all
of
this
and
much
more
have
been
saying
and
doing
this
too0
because
you
have
failed
as
so
many
others
have
failed
to
is
not
a
good
limiting
principle
unless
again
you
are
willing
to
go
all
the
way
back
and
throw
out
most
of
modern
commerce
clause
jurisprudence0
the
perennial
problem
with
teh
libertarian
discussion
is
that
everyone
seems
to
use
a
different
definition
i
think
pzs
usually
referring
to
the
complete
throughandthrough
libertarian
the
one
who
thinks
government
is
basically
illegitimate
if
it
does
anything
beyond
providing
a
military
others
who
might
call
themselves
libertarians
dont
go
all
the
way
there
but
they
dont
seem
to
get
that
their
personal
definitions
arent
necessarily
widely
known
to
other
people
its
like
christians
getting
all
butthurt
thats
not
my
kind
of
christianity0
we
didnt
actually
go
all
the
way
around
bainbridge
island
when
we
left
brownsville
sunday
afternoon
but
thats
pretty
much
what
would
have
happened
if
we
had
we
tacked
south
through
port
orchard
in
the
teeth
of
a
15
knot
breeze
fought
our
way
through
rich
passage
against
3
knots
of
current
then
found
ourselves
tacking
back
north
to
get
to
blakely
harbor
for
the
night0
you
are
right
lime
can
not
go
all
the
way
up
in
the
tubes
however
if
you
change
the
ph
in
the
vj
it
does
change
the
ph
in
the
cervical
crips
and
that
in
turn
does
change
the
ph
in
the
uterius
which
then
does
change
the
ph
in
the
tubes
which
does
change
the
ph
by
the
egg
but
no
the
lime
does
not
go
up
there0
go
all
the
way
it
could
mean
not
eating
for
3
or
4
days
it
could
mean
freezing
on
a
park
bench
it
could
mean
jail
it
could
mean
derision
mockery
isolation
isolation
is
the
gift
all
the
others
are
a
test
of
your
endurance
of
how
much
you
really
want
to
do
it
and
youll
do
it
despite
rejection
and
the
worst
odds
and
it
will
be
better
than
anything
else
you
can
imagine0
also
known
as
a
worst

scenario
called
the
china
syndrome
the

is
that
such
a
meltdown
in

melt
through

go
all
the

to
a

10

cooling

i
think
this
is
a
failure
of
the
authorities
in
several
ways
first
of
all
if
political
views
were
an
issue
at
all
then
all
potential
foster
parents
should
be
surveyed
about
this
secondly
this
seems
very
arbitrary
and
smacks
of
political
punishment
and
is
definitely
a
conflict
of
interest
and
if
not
then
why
not
go
all
the
way
and
remove
everyone
in
government
who
is
a
political
enemy
now
if
they
reverse
this
decision
it
will
result
in
their
humiliation
and
questioning
of
their
ethics0

part
of
that
is

want

to

part

that

work0
there
are
some
good
scenes
hudson

follow
the

rule
that
in

about
dying
women
the
woman
must
become
more
beautiful
as
her
disease
progresses
in
this
case
marley
eventually
starts
looking
like
death
warmed
over
although
hudson
was
apparently
unwilling
to
go
all
the
way
and
shave
her
head
to
excuse
this
lapse
the
script
helpfully
informs
us
that
her
treatment
would
not
cause
all
her
hair
to
fall
out
someone
should
have
told
joseph
gordon
levitt
about
this
before
he
made
50500
while
she
seems
to
recognize
that
bandages
can
help
a
person
who
is
wounded
she
seems
to
lack
expertise
in
medicine
as
seen
from
her
treatment
of
zoros
wounds
she
covered
him
from
head
to
toe
in
an
overabundance
of
bandages
the
first
time
she
found
him
however
despite
this
fault
she
has
common
sense
or
enough
knowledge
of
medical
skills
as
zoro
recovered
from
his
injuries
she
also
has
at
least
some
knowledge
of
navigation
seeing
how
she
brought
zoro
to

the

kierkegaards

several
of

he

way
using
the
same
tactics
that
the

uses
to
attack
the

this

just

attacks
in

the

means
of
identifying
one
self
anonymously
in
this
context
is
invalid
you
know
what
clich
this
point
refers
to0
this
discussion
is
hilarious
buschman
manages
to
ignore
any
and
every
actual
argument
thrown
at
him
responding
only
that
the
arguments
are
invalid
because
the
person
voicing
them
is
anonymous0
especially
when
the
particular
examples
are
found
repeatedly
across
the
spectrum
right
i
guess
we
have
to
dismiss
such
data
as
serial
outliers
and
invent
a
new
statistical
equaiton
that
leaves
those
outliers
out
of
the
loop
if
it
doesnt
have
a
phd
backing
the
information
is
invalid0
anyone
looking
at
these
differences
can
easily
see
that
the
study
conclusions
are
invalid
the
same
reasoning
that
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
smoking
rate
dropped
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
percentage
of
males
dropped
and
that
the
percentage
of
freshman
dropped
and
that
the
percentage
of
students
living
in
residence
halls
dropped
as
a
result
of
the
tobaccofree
policy0
in
fact
the
lippert
and
gustat
study
which
anr
cites
as
its
only
usbased
multistate
study
is
the
weakest
of
all
studies
on
smoking
previously
there
are
two
major
flaws
of
this
study
which
render
its
conclusion
invalid0
actually
the
tobacco
industry
no
longer
argues
that
secondhand
smoke
is
not
a
risk
factor
for
heart
disease
and
to
my
contention
that
studies
like
dr
hurts
are
invalid
because
they
contain
no
comparison
group
in
fact
that
the
tobacco
companies
have
decided
to
stop
publicly
challenging
these
conclusions
is
precisely
the
reason
why
i
believe
the
science
in
the
antismoking
movement
is
deteriorating
we
are
losing
the
rigor
of
our
science
because
we
can
now
get
away
with
it0
noga1
no
not
all

its

survival
your
argument
is
invalid0
for
me
though
the
main
reason
i
dont
use
it
is
most
sites
that
i
want
to
use
it
on
reject
the
in
the
address
as
invalid
it
happens
enough
that
i
dont
bother
trying
anymore0
however
even
though
im
a
firm
believer
in
standards
im
beyond
sick
and
tired
of
trying
to
figure
out
what
works
and
what
does
not
work
according
to
the
w3c
specification
so
while
i
make
every
attempt
to
do
the
right
thing
occasionally
ill
just
do
what
i
have
to
get
the
thing

you

dont

sending
me
an

if
for
example
you
use
the
call

method

an
invalid

is
requested
then
instead
of
throwing

is
vague

shipley
was

a

although
schroeder
said
he
doesnt
know
how
much
shipley
will

he
said
it

the
ajcs
harris
said
his
group
knew
it
would
be
criticized
for
commissioning
smith
to
do
the
study
smith
was
known
to
be
skeptical
about
the
figure
of
6
million
us
muslims
last
year
he
told
the
los
angeles
times
that
the
number
was
completely
invalid
and
that
muslim
groups
were
inventing
an
estimate0
however
the
supreme
court
held
that
this
was
the
wrong
approach
rather
in
assessing
whether
the
disclosure
requirements
are
met
the
court
must
consider
the
specification
as
a
whole
including
all
of
the
claims
separate
claims
may
not
signify
separate
inventions
section
58
of
the
patent
act
allows
for
a
valid
claim
to
survive
despite
one
or
more
invalid
claims
but
this
section
applies
only
after
the
invalidity
analysis
including
whether
disclosure
requirements
have
been
met0
although
there
is
no
express
remedy
for
insufficient
disclosure
in
the
patent
act
here
where
the
patent
was
found
to
encompass
a
single
invention
failure
of
disclosure
was
said
by
the
supreme
court
to
have
rendered
the
entire
patent
invalid
if
there
is
no
quid
proper
disclosure
then
there
can
be
no

rights0
as
mentioned
earlier
the
process
of
selecting
random
individuals
requires
an
enumeration
of
all
individuals
this
enumeration
can
be
an
exhausting
task
it
might
be
tempting
to
use
other
techniques
for
the
random
selection
of
individuals
one
of
the
most
tempting
shortcuts
is
to
use
the
coordinate
system
to
find
a
random
location
then
select
the
nearest
individual
for
measurement
although
this
sounds
good
it
is
both
technically
invalid
and
can
produce
bad
data0

she

supported
for
so
many

now
was
going

much
younger

why

the

nonexistent

not

is
no

of
wicked
where
in
response
to

beautiful
calls
herself
beautifully
tragic

she
does
it
much
more
honestly

convinces
glinda

that
elphaba
has
limitations
she
can
not
overcome1
nbc
likely
would
settle
out
of
court
but
that
also
doesnt
make
his
claim
invalid
the
only
reason
nbc
gets
away
with
things
like
this
is
because
most
people
think
like
you
wrongly
and
dont
recognize
that
they
have
rights
to
the
content
they
created
nbc
will
freely
sue
others
for
copyright
inhouse
legal
department
or
budget
to
do
the
same
again
that
does
not
mean
they
dont
have
claims
though0
but
a
few
of
you
here
need
to
see
a
therapist
not
because
your
anger
is
invalid
but
because
it
is
directed
in
impractical
directions0
the
film
which
you
are
about

account
of
the
tragedy
that
befell
a
group
of
five
youths
in
particular
sally
hardesty
and
her
invalid
brother
franklin
it
is
all
the
more
tragic
in
that
they
were
young
but
had
they
lived
very
very
long
lives
they
could
not
have
expected
nor
would
they
have
wished
to
see
as
much
of
the
mad
and
macabre
as
they
were
to
see
that
day
for
them
an
idyllic
summer
afternoon
drive

a

how
do
i
correct
this0
the
one
thing
that
you
have
to
know
is
that
this
interview
happened
just
over
12
months
ago
klout
and
their
ilk
had
just
started
to
become
fodder
for
public
discussion
and
they
were
on
their
first
iteration
of
invalid
measurement
algorithms
at
the
time
they
thought
they
were
being
advanced
in
their
thinking
as
did
many
others
who
were
all
about
klout
back
then0
maybe
if
somebody
can
create
a
security
camera
that
show
lavatory
users
as
grey
anonymous
asexual
computerized
dolls
then
this
can
be
a
feature
to
prevent

for

there
is
no
formal

john
mcdonald
told
me
but
crew

know
what
they
ought
to
do
he
was
quick
to
add
obviously
the
flight
attendants
would
assist
the
passenger
with
their
needs
be
it
to
help
them
to
the
lavatory
for
privacy
offer
a
blanket
if
requested
or
some
ice
to
cool
bottles
of
milk
if
they
pump
before

said1

thanks

you
lord

this

grimy

are
so
convenient1
while
the
three
garmin
riders
leipheimer
is
let
go
from
quickstep
as
the
cycling
world
digests
the
report
it
becomes
more
and
more
clear
that
the
avalanche
will
bury
not
only
these
american
riders
but
will
come
crashing
down
on
the
entire
professional
peloton
related
riders1
perhaps
as
many
as
5000
more
people
have
been
laid
off
since
march

one
former

who
was
let
go
in

the
sophomore
laughed
that
he
wasnt
supposed
to
hold
onto
the
ball
when
quarterback
bryan
bennett
handed
off
to
him
in
the
third
quarter
saturday
night
against
arizona
neither
lyerla
nor
bennett
would
let
go
so
both
scored
together
from
a
yard
out0
i
left
out
some
info
for
this
to
make
more
sense
i
had
a
manger
that
would
send
out
emails
at
4
am
with
typos
galore
or
sometimes
theyd
be
about
attending
a
certain
event
he
wanted
us
all
to
go
to
then
hed
forget
about
it
and
just
make
lots
of
weird
decisions
about
it
turns
out
he
liked
to
hit
the
was
let
go

other
reasons

running
high

nights

from
the
romney
camp
grudgingly
let

his
campaign
conceded

yesterday
over
in

addressed

in

20s

this

let
go
your
conscious
self

act
on
instinct0
let
go

move
forward0
only
a
fraction
of
lockheeds
workers
ultimately
would
be
let
go
as
a
result
of
the
cuts
but
the
company
plans
to
send

it
is
unsure
exactly
which

unfortunately
i
didnt
have
a

of
information
about
the
circumstances
or
problems
that
lead
to
the
husband
moving
out
or
what
he
said
when
he
did
but
its
my
belief
that
just
because
one
spouse
moves
out
this
doesnt
necessarily
mean
that
the
marriage
is
over
or
that
you
have
to
just
let
go
immediately

will
discuss

had
this

one
of
them
i
was
trying

i
looked

smashed

i
was
let
go
on

discharge
about
a
week
ago

ive
kind
of
been
running
across
the
country
damn
i
dont
gon
na
um
theyll
triangulate
on
this
position
really
soon1
my
feeling
on
this
is
that
they
wont
play
ball
with
obamas
adgenda
tpab
adgenda
so
they
are

can

that

currently

i

let
go
of

listen
i
will
say
this
i
am
aware
that
you
guys
all
of
my
students
at
uvm
have
very
few
black
professors
i
am
aware
in
fact
that
i
may
be
the
first
black
teacher
many
of
you
have
ever
had
and
the
way
i
dress
for
class
reflects
my
awareness
of
that
possibility
it
no
more0
i
felt
a
slight
moan
slip
my
lips
as
he
ran
his
hand
under
my
black
lace
bra
touching
and
tweaking
my
already
hard
nipple
he
let
go
of
my
leg
which
i
kept
hitched
around
his
waist
and
ran
his
hand
up
my
back
in
one
movement
he
had
unclipped
my
bra
and
he
slowly
slid
the
straps
off
of
my
shoulders
revealing
new
skin
that
he
barely
hesitated
in
covering
with
kisses0

me
90

the
immigrants
will
do
it
in

the
holy
man
asked
him
first
to
let
go
of
his
legs
and
when
he
had
done
so
put
his
hands
out
and
touched
a
couple
of
things
around
him
and
they
fell
down
in
a
clanging
heap
of
rupees
his
joy
knew
no
bounds
he
jumped
up
and
down
touching
everything
he
could
see
turning
things
into
heaps
of
rupees0
the
holy
man
quickly
said
let
go
of
the
legs
first
released
himself
then
said
so
be
it0
let
go
of
fear
it
is
through
fear
that
negative
entities
maintain
control
anger
is
a
more
effective
defense
than
fear0
let
go
of
the
assumption
that
the
world
is
against
you
or
that
you
were
born
with
a
gray
cloud
over
your
head
it
is
sometimes
we
pick
up
a
flair
for
pessimism
from
a
parent
who
made
negative
assumptions
about
the
world
somewhere
along
the
line
either
way
the
sooner
you
can
attribute
your
pessimism
to
a
unique
set
of
circumstances
rather
than
the
state
of
the
world
itself
the
easier
itll
be
to
change
your
perspective0
specifically
where
you
said
that
giving
up
and
giving
in
are
a
razors
edge
difference
although
i
think
there
is
truth
to
what
you
said
it
isnt
appropriately
applied
here
im
pretty
sure
that
the
overall
message
is
to
give
up
on
let
go
of
egodriven
external
bs
that
you
let
influence
distract
hold
you
back
from
your
self
but
obviously
not
to
give
up
on
caring
about
the
things
you
love
to
do0
where
i
overanalyze
them
to
pieces
if
i
do
this
then
this
bad
thing
will
happen
but
if
not
then
this
will
happen
sometimes
when
you
let
go
of
the
reins
the
problems
will
suddenly
fall
into
place
and
the
path
is
clear
i
often
forget
what
in
the
world
i
was
so
worried
about0
so
i
agree
that
sometimes
we
have
to
let
go
of
the
preconceptions
others
have
given
us
concerning
life
and
happiness
but
i
certainly
disagree
that
giving
up
is
a
way
to
progress
though
it
may
be
a
way
to
wipe
your
slate
clean
so
that
you
may
work
forward
from
there0
this
is
beautiful
it
is
great
that
people
have
diverse
opinions
on
the
subject
it
seems
that
to
be
most
clear
to
everyone
people
can
replace
the
words
give
up
with
let
go

up

the
way

very
long

finally
admitting
that
i
have
dreams
and
that
it
may
be
scary
to
admit
what
they
are
they
seem
so
impossible

far
away

being
afraid
of
whats
next

ai
nt
that
all

for

no

in

is
now
utterly
in

for
another
i
think
there
is
a
cultlike
following
around
this
president
that
neutralizes
criticism
and
logic
third
he
has
a
shameless
and
ruthless
campaign
organization
and
administration
that
will
say
and
do
anything
with
a
straight
face1
when
i
see
comments
like
this
it
reinforces
my
view
that
the
whole
debate
is
painfully
slowly
perhaps
approaching
a
neutralized
state
if
one
takes
a
multidimensional
view
it
almost
cant
end
up
anywhere
but
neutralized
theres
just
too
much
discord
and
some
of
it
is
fierce0
after
quickly
coming
up
with
yes
yes
it
seemed
sensible
to
expect
to
see
the
debate
neutralize
itself
since
sensible
people
will
be
on
the
case
raising
the
game
and
eventually
become
differentiated
from
the
issue
of

was
that

leftism

what
gives
in

opinion
its
mostly
demographics
paul
is
controversial
outspoken
and
amusing
and
those
sorts
of
people
do
well
on

politicians
or
not
he
may
lack
mainstream
commercial
campaign
backers
but
his
type

cause
has
always
flourished
on
the

and
we
dont
see
that
stopping
any0
in
the
meantime
the
vatican
went
all
out
unsuccessfully
to
try
to
defeat
president
obama
an
outspoken
critic
of
child
sex
abuse
as
noted
here0
i
always
feel
it
is
such
a
shame
hillary
clinton
was
not
elected
four
years
ago
she
has
been
much
more
outspoken
on
human
rights
in
china
than
obama0
hulme
recognizes
a
simple
fact
about
human
behavior
which
is
the
more
passionate
emotionally
connected
and
outspoken
one
is
to
a
position
or
cause
the
more
resistant
and
less
rational
and
logical
one
will
be
in
accepting
any
information
that
runs
to
the
contrary0
from
this
basic
social
exercise
i
became
more
outspoken
sounds
like
a
filler
sentence
combine
this
with
another
sentence0
i
tried
for
years
to
understand
i
had
bad
relationships
i
even
told
my
mom
i
was
going
to
a
counselor
and
her
response
i
hope
you
dont
want
me
to
come
in
with
you
my
friends
daughter
wanted
her
to
go
to
counseling
with
her
and
i
couldnt
believe
it
everything
was
my
fault
i
was
too
sensitive
too
crazy
too
honest
too
outspoken0
personally
i
dont
think
the
tone
has
changed
at
all
and
bitching
and
snarking
is
exactly
why
i
am
here
in
fact
it
was
a
friend
at
another
site
that
steered
me
here
got
banned
from
another
place
for
being
too
well
outspoken0
i
was
a
little
slow
to
embrace
the
turn
of
the
season
but
as
i
sit
here
the
fog
lays
low
over
the
hills
beyond
my
home
misting
the
the
trees
still
full
of
its
leaves
with
light
drops
of
rain
i
trust
that
the
sun
is
there
somewhere
behind
the
clouds
it
has
given
me
the
chance
to
reacquaint
myself
with
an
old
friend
my
oven
has
been
neglected
these
last
few
months

hope
that

you

it

a

the

probably
paid

actually
believed

thats
awesome

refreshing
so
many
hollywood

seem
to
forget
that
they
are
where
they
are
because
of
their
fans

was
in
high
school
in
the
sorry
to
hear
he
passed
its
a
real
loss
when
people
like
that
pass
on
or
as
in

better
brains
can
improve
their

and
thereby
increase
the
chance
that
they
will
pass
on

genes
specifically
tied
to
the
better
brain
the
brain
is
the
driving
force
in
the
equation0
but
we
dont
even
need
any
studies
to
realize
how
true
this
is
in
the
case
of
procreation
people
procreate
in
order
to
perpetuate
the
illusion
that
they
will
not
die
that
they
will
live
on

that
they
will

it
is

the
type
of
experience
that
ultimately
leads
to
the
loss
of
customers
dissatisfied
customers
sharing
their
complaints
with
family

who
then
pass
on
the
negative

to
even

whites
too
have
a
right
to
exist
the
primary
duty
you
have
as
a
human
being
is
to
preserve
the
heritage
of
your
ancestors
and
pass
on
to
your
children
a
country
they
can
call
their
own
and
where
they
can
live
in
dignity0
i
bet
that
we
all
will
be
studying
these
new
options
very
closely
many
of
us
will
be
swayed
to
purchase
one
of
the
competitions
vehicles
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
i
have
said
myself
that
i
will
very
likely
purchase
a
new
honda
or
prius
this
fall
or
early
next
year
but
in
2011
or
2012
when
the
volt
gets
to
a
dealer
close
to
me
i
will
pass
on
to
my
wife
the
honda
or
prius
and
go
shopping
for
a
new
volt0
this
one
of
the
rare

would
say

of

he
has
already
done
that

he
gets
a

ever

you
cant

well
as
i
stated
previously
i
heard
an
undercurrent
of

transcended

i
never
actually
said

that
i
see
a
similarity
in
her
moral
outrage
to
zealots
i
also
never
said
she
was

forgive
me
if
i
pass
on

technically
mcqueen

the

whether

not

not
isnt
the
point
the
point
was
more

why
are

can

take
for

abuse
their

provisions
if
parents
effectively
explain
reinforce

elaborate
the
reasons
why
the
provisions
are

the
children
are
more
likely
to
value
the
provisions
not
only
value
the
provisions
from
their
parents
but
understand
the
importance
of
provisions

this
practice
becomes

special

vanden
eynden
explains
the
what
and
why
of
mediumship
and
differentiates
this
practice
with
that
of
psychics
the
difference
between
these
two
practices
is
that
a
medium
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
spirit
realm
gleaning
information
from
spirit
guides
or
those
who
have
passed
on
psychics
however
pick
up
information
via
telepathy
esp
etc
mediums
use
a
middleman
whereas
psychics
do
not
of
course
there
are
psychic
mediums
that
combine
these
practices1
thank
you
rachel
for
sharing
your
story
this
september
i
was
reminded
of
the
importance
of
volunteering
and
performing
random
acts
of
kindness
sept
12
would
have
been
my
friends
23rd
birthday
this
year
instead
of
being
sad
that
shes
passed
on
from
this
world
we
joined
forces
to
spread
random
acts
of
kindness1
among
my
facebook
friends
yesterday
more
than
one
wrote
publicly
that
they
were
crying
or
cant
stop
crying
or
teared
up
due
to
steve
jobs
death
really
now
you
cant
stop
crying
now
that
youve
heard
that
a
middleaged
ceo
has
passed
on
after
a
long
battle
with
cancer
if
humans
were
always
so
empathetic
well
that
would
be
understandable
but
this
type
of
oneupmanship
of
public
displays
of
grief
is
both
unbecoming
and
undeserved1
when
it
was
desired
to
frighten
the
enemy
the
music
chosen
was
usually
funeral
music
or
sounds
that
invited
thoughts
of
death
or
those
who
had
passed
on
one
example
of
such
of
time1
this
fiesta
is
marked
by
the
invitation
by
the
living
to
the
dead
to
return
to
their
family
home
for
a
visit
families
place
photographs
of
their
loved
ones
who
have
passed
on
at
the
deceaseds
gravesite
or
on
a
family
altar
they
also
place
offerings
of
flowers
drinks
and
food
alongside
the
photographs
this
ritual
is
particularly
important
for
those
who
have
been
lost
in
the
year
since
the
previous
festival
and
is
a
way
of
coming
to
terms
with
the
death
of
someone
loved
and
missed1

but
once
i
opened
that
portly
paperback
none
of
that
mattered
i
wasnt
reading
it
for
himi
was
reading
it
for
me0
that
said
i
do
agree
with
him
that
limbaugh
should
apologize
or
better
yet
his
network
could
simply
pull
the
plug
on
him
and
it
would
make
me
even
happier1
demoncrats
not
only
do
we
want
to
pull
the
plug
on
grandma
kill
children
and
force
our
vets
to
commit
suicide
but
we
also
want
to
deny
care
to
and
therefore
possibly
kill
the
entire
gop
well
that
last
point
might
be
right1
they
are
seeking
to
redistribute
of
families
that
are
economically
and
politically
powerful
enough
to
endure
the
up
coming
events
and
harness
all
the
opportunities
created
by
the
meticulously
made
crisis
and
at
last
i
think
their
final
movement
its
the
destruction
of
local
governments
creating
an
economic
crisis
around
the
world
that
will
bring
governments
to
its
knees
once
they
pull
the
plug
of
the
money
supply
and
starts
rising
interest
rates1
higherups
had
a
chat
with
me
last
night
after
reading
some
exchanges
from
a
couple
of
days
ago
i
was
instructed
to
pull
the
plug
they
had
enough
already
as
a
compromise
were
settling
on
a
timeout
like
i
try
to
hint
all
of
the
time
its
better
to
behave
and
let
me
monitor
than
to
have
big
brother
monitor1
you
wait
they
gon
na
get
everybody
on
twitter
facebook
doing
everythin
online
and
then
they
gon
na
pull
the
plug
and
we
all
gon
na
be
fucked1
if
government
was
to

that
is
the
tea
party
nuts
for
you
and
here
these
wierdos
were
trying
to
say
president
obama
wanted
to
pull
the
plug
of
grandma
the
up
on
a
little
thing
called
mercy
how
about
this
idea
care
about
our
fellow
human
beings
yea
the
tea
party
nuts
just
care
about
their
wallet1
on
the
one
hand
no
government
can
genuinely
come
to
love
harsh
austerity
as
an
endinitself
and
to
be
able
to
continue
imposing
it
relentlessly
in
the
face
of
increasing
popular
discontent
just
ask
herbert
hoover
or
indeed
george
papandreou
on
the
other
hand
no
ecb
president
can
convince
politicians
that
he
will
prefer
to
pull
the
plug
on
an
omt
program
rather
than
find
a
rationale
to
continue
with
it
if
their
fiscal
targets
are
continually
missed
and
they
relent
in
their
implementation
of
increasingly
harsh
austerity1
italy
is
experiencing
its
own
version
of
the
terry
schiavo
case
a
woman
eluana
englaro
was
in
a
car
crash
17
years
ago
that
caused
catastrophic
brain
damage
shes
been
in
a
vegetative
state
ever
since
and
the
family
has
been
engaged
in
a
legal
fight
for
many
years
to
pull
the
plug
and
allow
her
to
die
with
a
little
dignity
they
finally
won
that
battle
recently
and
are
easing
her
off
life
support
and
a
feeding
tube1
my
grandfather
went
into
a
vegetative
state
after
a
doctors
mistake
and
subsequent
efforts
to
cover
it
up
his
neurologist
told
us
that
he
barely
had
enough
brain
activity
to
maintain
a
pulse
and
that
there
was
no
hope
of
recovery
fortunately
he
had
a
living
will
and
my
family
had
the
hospital
pull
the
plug1
also
please
explain
atheists
morally
reprehensible
ties
directly
to
the
subject
of
this
blog
entry
which
is
about
the
italian
prime
minister
refusing
to
pull
the
plug
on
a
braindead
woman
because
after
consultation
with
the
vatican
her
ovaries
are
still
functional1

and
that
is
what
creates
the
vortex
you
can
observe
it
every
time
you
pull

on
a

or

drag

make

i
give
her
a
look
in
time
for
what
he
slid
into
a
ditch
its
not
like
someones
waiting
at
the
hospital
to
pull
the
plug
on
him1
but
that
evening
wren
stopped
breathing
they
called
911
the
emts
were
jones
and
kau
learned
that
oxygen
deprivation
had
left
him
brain
dead
and
so
as
they
held
his
hand
they
let
the
doctors
pull
the
plug
after
an
autopsy
the
couple
learned
that
wren
had
died
from
pneumonia
due
to
a
group
b
strep
infection
contracted
during
delivery1
and
re
your
investors
pull
the
plug
on
the
direct
subsidies
and
the
indirect
priority
in
the
dispatch
order
and
renewables
mandates
subsidies
and
then
see
how
much
gets
built
according
to
awea
near
zero0
so
the
subsidy
argument
pops
up
again
if
you
pull
the
plug
out
of
nuclear
power
ie
completely
deregulate
the
market
the
entire
nuclear
industry
will
go
bankrupt
for
various
reasons

no

possible
no
private

available
insufficient
roi
on

miscellaneous
liability
problems
inability
to
bunch
of
other
reasons0
just
so
you
know
i
never
want
to
live
in
a
vegetative
state
dependent
on
some
machine
and
fluids
from
a
bottle
if
that
ever
happens
just
pull

rush
is
to
big
to
be

his
fans
would
go

rush
is
the
only
one
that
i
listen
to
regularly
these
days0
the
romney
campaign
isnt
dead
its
just
brain
dead
and
the
gop
will
pull
the
plug
on
the
day
after
the
first
debate
obama
wont
get
more
than
365
electoral
which
was
his
total
against
the
last
guy
you
idiots
swore
up
until
the
last
hour
was
going
to
win
big
but
he
will
get
over
325
by
our
counting0
hey
foofighter
i
hope
they
pull
the
plug
on
you
as
soon
as
possible
you
people
are
a
bunch
of
fucking
assholes
talking
about
who
should
die
all
of
you
here
go

yourselves
i
hope
everyone

die

nasty

a
few
days
ago
i
went
out
of
town
and
i
thought
itd
be
wise
to
pull
the
plugs
for
my
tv
pc
consoles
etc
to
avoid
having
anything
be
on
standby
and
consuming
i
know
very
small
amounts
of
power0
the
world
of
today
going
to
pull
the
plug
on
the
capitalist
consumption
lifestyle
of
the
west
which
is
increasingly
moving
east
and
i
say
about
time0
the
smart
answer
might
be
to
pull
the
plug
on
ourselves
but
im
sure
the
vast
majority
would
rather
remain
exactly
the
way
they
are
striving
to
amass
worthless
currency
and
silly
possessions
while
the
tableau
that
is
their
home
planet
degrades
until
it
reaches
the
point
when
it
must
slough
off
most
of
us
to
cleanse
itself1
any
way
you
look
at
it
there
are
a
significant
number
of
coal
units
that
need
to
pull
the
plug
on
their
operations
here
in
the
southeast
121
with
the
high
estimate
and
47
by
the
low
estimate0
besides
the
decision
to
pull
the
plug
on
googles

database
at
the
end
of
what

probably
a
fiveyear
contract
had
to
have
been
made

michael
vick
benching
rumors
swilled
for
weeks
while
philadelphia
eagles
coach
andy
reid
could
not
pull
the
plug
on
vick
for
fear
of
losing
his
own
job
the
decision
was
made
for
him
sunday
vick
was
knocked
out
of
the
eagles
game
against
the
dallas
cowboys
after
suffering
a
concussion
prior
to
the
concussion
vick
had
been
a
turn
over
machine
for
the
eagles
who
have
now
lost0
no
offense
dude
but
apparently
you
do
nt
work
in
a
hospital
or
nursing
home
go
they
are
gorked
and
turned
every
2
hours
to
prevent
bed
sores
that
means
they
are
not
moving
on
their
own
and
probably
not
totally
aware
of
what
is
going
on
pull
the
plug
baby
or
let
the
family
pay
their
20
share

while
whitman
is
at
the
helm
of
hp
she
wasnt
the
one
to
pull
the
plug
on
palm
and
webos
phones
and
tablets
that
move
was
made
by
her
predecessor
lo
apotheker
whitman
who
has
been
on
the
job
at
hp
for
about
a
year
now
said
a
major
reason
she
wants
to
steer
the
company
back
into
phones
is
because
phones
are
the
prime
growth
area
in
the
computing
industry0
even
richard
nixon
came
to
the
realization
that
there

in
an
otherwise
endless
war0

report

against
the
wishes
of
more
than
a
billion
of

suggests
that

will
have

some

reasons
in

routine
maintenance
has
already
allowed
the

general
electric
the
american
wind
energy
association

other

giants
are
fighting
to
extend
tax
credits
for

energy
if
republicans
attacked
these
credits
as
corporate
welfare
and
simultaneously
pulled
the
plug
on
tax
credits
for
the
oil
industry
they
could
plant
a
flag
as
scourges
of
the
special

if
they
kill
these

they

got
stuck
facing

then
they
had
to
leave
before
the
showdown
of
course
considering
buford
was
sent
to
jail
before
they
left
they
could
have
pulled
the
plug
on
the
whole
thing
at
that
point
maybe
since
it
was
already
the

at

i
take
not

of

anyone
have
advice

how
to

is

punishing

you
wont

its
sad
that
you
werent
as
loyal
to
him
as
he
was
to
you
he
will
likely
be
put
to
sleep
that
would
be
the
best
scenario
the
worst
would
be
that
he
would
be
mistreated
for
awhile
before
being
put
down1
the
process
itself
was
very
peaceful

the

and
i
sat

petted

held
both

were
gone

never

the
debate
over
how
to
deal
with
irans
nuclear
program
is
clouded
by
historical
amnesia
nuclear
proliferation
has
been
stopped
before
and
it
can
and
should
be
stopped
in
this
case
as
well
unfortunately
with
tehran
as
with
some
of
its
predecessors
the
price
for
washington
will
be
relinquishing
the
threat
of
regime
change
by
force0
most
of
the
information
in
the
report
was
drawn
from
two
lengthy
assessments
issued
by
the
national
intelligence
council
in
january
2003
titled
principal
challenges
in
postsaddam
iraq
and
regional
consequences
of
regime
change
in
iraq
both
of
which
the
senate
report
reprints
with
only
minor
redactions
the
assessments
were
requested
by
richard
state
department
and
were
written
by
paul
r
pillar
the
national
intelligence
officer
for
the
near
east
as
a
synthesis
of
views
across
the
16agency
intelligence
community1
the
obama
administration
has
been
actively
supporting
regime
change
through
out
the
middle
east
and
handing
the
entire
region
to
the
mb
complicit
in
this
is
saudi
arabia
and
qatar
which
are
both
mbalqaeda
sponsors1
mr
fleischer
actually
the
president
has
made
it
very
clear
that
he
has
not
dispute
with
the
people
of
iraq
thats
why
the
american
policy
remains
a
policy
of
regime
change
ms
thomas
thats
a
decision
for
them
to
make
isnt
it
its
their
country1
today
the
federal
government
funds
a
program
of
flying
drones
and
killing
people
and
destroying
property
in
nations
such
as
yemen
afghanistan
pakistan
somalia
iraq
libya
and
others
it
also
exports
military
equipment
for
others
to
use
to
kill
and
maim
and
supports
regime
change
wherever
it
sees
fit
vietnam
was
a
fabrication
from
a
false
flag
incident
that
never
happened

im
stating
that
the
argument
for
human
rights
alone
is
compelling
and
motivating
but
that
the
combination
in
any
formulation
of
single
state
with
human
rights
is
an
advocacy
for
the
elimination
of
israel
revolution
externally
coerced
regime
change1
but
so
long
as
us
foreign
policy
continues
to
be
one
of
unchecked
regime
changeism
or
even
one
of
simply
profiting
fromriding
the
wave
of
perpetual
mideast
chaos
russia
will
be
in
a
defensive
posture
you
can
probably
say
hello
to

successor

ambassador
to

who
recently
achieved
some
notoriety
on
twitter
for
calling
madonna
an
old
whore1
is
it
rational
to
use
trade
sanctions
to
achieve
regime
change
in
iran
iran
is
ruled
by
a
peculiar
tyranny
that
allows
a
little
limited
democracy
thats
what
the
us
seems
to
be
heading
towards1
the
last
thing
that
needs
to
be
said
is
that
a
vegetable
farmer
in
like
egypt
or
tunisia
after
sell
from
the
road
side
burnt
himself
that
started
the
overthrown
of
numerous
government
in
the
middle
east
north
africa
the
us
government
realizes
that
their
approval
numbers
are
at
all
time
historical
lows
that
might
well
be
enough
to
spark
a
revolution
regime
change
in
the
usa
government
officials
are
not
stupid
when
it
comes
to
threats
against
their
powermake
no
mistake1
an
attack
on
iran
could
set
back
irans
ability
to
build
a
nuclear
weapon
but
not
stop
the
program
permanently
barring
a
decision
to
doubt
that
us
military
attacks
from
the
air
plus
other
means
such
as
drones
covert
operations
and
cyberattacks
could
eliminate
irans
capability
to
build
a
nuclear
weapon
bring
about
regime
change
or
force
iran
to
capitulate
to
us
demands1

israel
and
the
us
have
been
crowing
for
regime
change
in
iran
for
nearly
a
decade
now
in
this
last
election
the
urban
youth
and
elite
have
combined
together
to
organize
a
color
revolution
just
like
happened
in
georgia
just
like
happened
in
ukraine
those
two
paragons
of
democracy
where
we
all
know
the
cia
didnt
have
even
the
slightest
bit
of
involvement1
the
only
way
to
take
the
desire
for
nukes
from
the
iranians
is
for
them
to
see
its
either
in
their
selfinterest
not
sure
how
to
do
that
but
examples
being
safrica
libya
though
that
didnt
turn
out
so
well
for
that
guy
or
regime
change
which
means
full
scale
war
something
the
israelis
are
not
capable
of1
i
laughed
so
hard
i
nearly
fell
out
of
my
chair
its
about
time
the
rest
of
the
world
realized
we
dont
all
go
along
with
current
american
foreign
policy
and
that
given
a
choice
we
will
work
for
regime
change
where
it
matters
most0
i
just
hope
that
all
the
liberals
out
there
can
band
together
to
make
a
regime
change
at
home
even
if
you
dont
like
kerry
all
that
much
who
cares
hes
1000
better
than
the
alternative0
tempterrain
that
is
what
he
is
saying
climate
models
have
no
better
long
term
predictive
skill
that
stock
market
models
that
doesnt
mean
they
cant
be
useful
though
since
there
are
somewhat
predictable
states
and
behaviors
from
various
initial
conditions
but
every
time
there
is
a
regime
change
or
climate
shift
it
is
a
new
ball
game
i
believe
i
differ
with
chief
here
because
i
think
they
can
be
more
predictive
with
better
ocean
oscillation
consideration0
jones
said
the
obama
administration
is
not
pushing
regime
change
in
iran
hoping
the
iranian
people
will
fight
for
their
best
interests1
they
tried
to
convince
clinton
to
invade
and
began
dismantling
and
defunding
antiterrorist
efforts
and
ignoring
intelligence
warnings
from
the
day
they
took
office
romney
repeatedly
used
the
term
new
american
century
in

behind

the

down
throughout

again
today
probably
in
anticipation

especially
huge
protests

confrontations
planned

off

some

already
seem
to
be
down
also
check
out
this
state
department
cable
from
december
30
2008
via
wikileaks
concluding
that
the
prospect
of
regime
change
in
egypt
was
highly
unrealistic0
you
know
its
very
difficult
to
argue
with
someone
who
doesnt
understand
that
israel
undergoes
a
regime
change
quite
often
that
offer
is
rabin
still
alive
no
he
was
assassinated
netanyahu
will
not
make
a
similar
offer
because
netanyahu
is
a
jewish
extremist1
do
any
democrats
who
genuflect
at
the
altar
of
jfk
actually
realize
that
he
was
hardly
the
model
of
progressivism
vietnam
massive
tax
cuts
strength
through
a
forceful
military
dared
soviets
with
a
nuke
standoff
attempted
regime
change
in
cuba
talk
about
incompetence1
so
the
only
real
option
for
the
us
to
stop
iran
harassing
the
straits
is
a
full
scale
invasion
of
the
whole
of
iran
just
like
the
us
invaded
iraq
in
2003
and
a
regime
change
in
iran
resulting
from
this
the
problem
with
this
iran
is
larger
as
iraq
and
afghanistan
combined
and
its
military
is
in
good
shape
and
has
invested
a
lot
in
asymmetric
warfare1
now
in
this
scenario
iran
might
still
get
a
bomb
which
many
of
us
find
unacceptable
myself
included
but
nothing
short
of
regime
change
or
iran
voluntarily
stopping
is
going
to
end
that
quest
and
so
i
think
if
this
is
about
the
money
we
ought
to
consider
carefully
how
were
going
to
try
to
achieve
that1
just
giving
birth
doesnt
make
someone

proactive1
so
calling
mormonism
a
cult
is
a
theological
debate
that
has
become
politicized
while
the
debate
over
abortion
and
same
sex
marriage
is
not1
franklin
also
said
in
decision
magazine
there
is
no
place
for
comprmise
or
straight
forward
moral
issues
such
as
abortion
and
same
sex
marriage
god
has
given
us
clear
biblical
direction
that
we
must
follow
and
obey1
honeybe
what
is
so
stupid
about
legalizing
marijuana
and
industrial
favor
of
repealing
doma
because
it
is
unconstitutional
and
which
takes
the
right
to
license
marriage
away
from
the
states
and
places
it
with
the
federal
government
neither
was
in
favor
of
recognizing
the
same
sex
marriages
from
ny
massachusetts
iowa
etc
in
their
home
states
which
is
what
states
rights
calls
for
they
are
both
frauds

comments1
is
this
idea
floating
through
the
media
of
republicans
not
being
inclusive
the
idea
is
that
if
one
does
not
believe
in
abortion
or
same
sex
marriage
then
he
is
an
extremist
and
out
of
touch
with
the
mainstream
so
those
who
advocate
taking
an
innocent
defenseless
human
life
are
moderate
while
those
who
are
opposed
to
that
are
extreme
how
absurd
is
that1
in
an
interview
that
aired
friday
on
the
abc
family
channel
cbns
david
brody
asked
franklin
graham
where
the
country
is
going
now
that
a
president
who
approves
of
same
sex
marriage
will
be
in
office
four
more
years1
i
would
not
classify
his
comments
as
a
hate
speech
people
are
entitled
to
their
moral
and
religious
beliefs
cameron
did
not
advocate
violence
or
discrimination
so
why
would
it
be
considered
a
hate
speech
i
do
not
have
a
problem
witht
he
gay
community
and
even
believe
that
same
sex
couples
should
be
able
to
marry
i
also
believe
it
is
a
persons
right
to
be
able
to
freely
answer
a
question
or
speak
on
a
subject
as
long
as
they
do
it
in
a
respectful
manner0
next
question
is
calling
the
action
of
sexual
relations
between
same
sex
partners
unnatural
and
action
against
the
people
who
engage
in
those
sexual
relations
by
people
who
do
not
does
it
intimidate
gay
individuals
either
individually
or
as
a
group1
even
animals
know
not
to
have
sex
with
same
sex
animal
and
we
thought
humans
are
more
intelligent
than
animals
will
these
gay
people
be
even
in
this
world
if
they
did
not
have
a
female
as
mother
and
male
as
father
have
a
nice
day0
the
legislative
battle
picked
up
momentum
as
more
conservatives
became
convinced
a
federal
law
was
required
in
september
1996
the
united
states
congress
approving
what
was
called
the
defense
of
marriage
act
voted
overwhelmingly
to
deny
federal
benefits
to
married
people
of
the
same
sex
and
to
permit
states
to
ignore
such
marriages
sanctioned
in
other
states
the
bill
was
signed
by
president
bill
clinton0
i
think
your
best
point
is
bringing
to
light
the
ways
in
which
legal
same
sex
marriage
will
change
the
day
to
day
workings
of
catholics
the
church
and
her
apostolates
i
dont
think
the
problem
is
that
catholics
dont
care
about
the
issue
or
have
given
up
it
is
just
difficult
to
see
the
hidden
and
nuanced
ways
in
which
the
legalization
of
same
sex
marriage
will
the
daily
life
of
catholics
in
the
pew0
bombshell
moment
they
were
a
same
sex
couple
four
years
i
would
have
thought
you
have
a
lot
more
problems
than
adultery
youre
homosexual1
so
when
andy
hat
boy
comes
around
bashing
christians
and
cosnervatives
for
opposing
same
sex
marriage
by
called
them
bigots
he
will
be
condemned
for
denigrating
a
muslims
are
offended1
why
does
kurtz
respect
the
opinion
of
a
lot
of
people
opposed
to
same
sex
marriage
does
he
respect
the
opinion
of
those
who
would
deny
african
americans
or
jews
equal
rights
hes
behind
the
times
here
and
contributes
to
allowing
antiequality
people
solace1
kristi
i
agree
with
comment
4
a
really
unfortunate
juxtaposition
of
statements
at
the
beginning
of
the
article
which
seems
to
equate
accepting
marriage
equality
with
kissing
a
dog
i
actually
thought
this
would
have
led
into
the
fact
that
for
openly
gay
and
lesbian
individuals
hanging
out
with
a
coworking
of
the
same
sex
might
raise
eyebrows
that
might
be
interesting
to
look
into
to
now
that
more
gay
and
lesbian
people
feel
comfortable
with
being
open
about
their
sexuality
at
work
but
i
digress0
in
response
to
a
question
at
an
auckland
university
debate
earlier
this
month
about
freedom
of
religion
and
whether
churches
will
be
forced
to
host
same
sex
marriages
labour
mp
louisa
wall
responded
in
theory
someone
might
choose
to
get
married
in
a
church
hall
and
if
that
church
hires
it
out
then
they
cant
discriminate1
churches
do
not
already
have
to
host
there
is
no
such
thing
yet
as
a
same
sex
wedding
that
issue
will
only
arise
if
the
bill
is
passed
a
same
sex
wedding
in
a
church
mosque
or
tabernacle
would
signify
acceptance
of
the
marriage
that
would
be
entirely
new
and
would
certainly
not
be
business
as
usual
for
churches1
an
obligation
on
a
church
to
host
a
same
sex
wedding
in
combination
with
the
quite
separate
issue
of
church
ministers
who
are
celebrants
who
will
not
be
able
to
refuse
to
perform
same
sex
weddings
would
seriously
prejudice
the
religious
freedoms
of
churches
and
ministers1
all
of
these
passages
address
sexual
behavior
so
when
i
first
realized
i
was
gay
none
to
the
same
sex
but
i
wasnt
sexually
active
and
i
didnt
have
any
plans
to
be
my
plan
was
just
to
find
a
way
to
become
straight
so
that
i
could
be
attracted
to
a
woman
and
get
married0
for
example
i
hate
the
argument
that
god
made
me
this
way
attracted
to
the
same
sex
so
it
cant
be
a
sin
to
have
a
samesex
relationship0
well
if
within
your
own
home
includes
smoking
drinking
using
other
recreational
drugs
eating
too
much
knowingly
eating
or
drinkings
things
made
with
certain
ingredients
running
a
small
business
owning
a
firearm
living
with
a
spouse
of
the
same
sex
etc
rare
is
simply
not
the
right
word0
all
of
the
gay
people
i
know
are
loving
creative
individuals
whose
only
crime
is
that
they
love
another
human
being
and
yet
they
are
emotionally
jailed
by
many
in
the
straight
community
including
members
of
their
own
families
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
love
someone
of
the
same
sex0
theyre
fighting
in
our
armed
forces
holding
prominent
positions
in
our
government
taking
part
in
bettering
our
society
and
doing
all
kinds
of
ordinary
and
extraordinary
things
theyre
real
people
why
should
the
government
deny
them
equal
rights
closedminded
thinking
is
not
harmless
or
isolated
it
hurts
people
and
impacts
us
all
people
are
people
and
to
heck
with
anyone
loving
another
person
of
the
same
sex0
frc
president
tony
perkins
praised
the
infamous
kill
the
gays
bill
in
uphold
moral
conduct
that
protects
others
and
in
particular
the
most
vulnerable
the
bill
that
perkins
defended
called
for
life
in
prison
for
having
sex
even
once
with
a
member
of
the
same
sex
or
touching
someone
of
the
same
sex
with
the
intention
of
having
sex0
same
sex
marriage
is
not
overturning
5000
years
of
marital
tradition
there
were
rites
in
the
christian
tradition
in
the
10th
and
12th
centuries
for
gays
and
lesbians
to
marry1
marriage
as
an
institution
has
always
changed
to
suit
geographic
and
societal
norms
its
akin
to
polygamy
no
longer
existing
same
sex
marriage
is
not
an
affront
to
the
institution
its
already
a
part
of
its
rich
and
diverse
history
having
existed
in
past
cultures1
anyways
good
news
the
levers
pf
power
at
the
highest
level
in
this
country
are
tackling
same
sex
marriage
with
an
intensity
that
will
absolutely
knock
the
wind
out
of
the
bigots
they
have
no
idea
of
the
tidal
wave
that
is
going
to
submerge
them
i
cant
say
too
much
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
victory
is
close
at
hand
and
historic
progress
in
civil
rights
and
equality
is1
telling
a
gay
person
they
have
to
marry
someone
of
the
opposite
sex
is
like
telling
a
heterosexual
they
have
to
marry
someone
of
the
same
sex
there
would
be
no
love
to
ensure
the
longevity
of
the
union0
tunetown
seperation
of
church
and
state
is
not
in
the
constitution
get
a
copy
and
read
it
marriage
is
the
union
of
a
man
and
a
woman
the
giblet
community
has
got
it
wrong
the
union
of
two
people
of
the
same
sex
is
called
something
else
the
agenda
filter
here
doesnt
allow
me
to
give
you
that
word0
it
is
absolutely
idiotic
to
argue
about
these
things
love
is
love
whether
between
a
man
and
a
woman
or
between
two
women
or
between
two
men
you
dont
need
marriage
to
have
love
but
it
is
wrong
to
deny
it
to
someone
who
wishes
to
marry
just
because
they
want
to
marry
a
person
of
the
same
sex
homosexuality
is
found
in
all
species
homophobia
is
found
in
one
which
do
you
think
the
universe
will
see
as
strange0
i
agree
with
mrs
bachmann
in
all
she
has
said
all
these
gays
want
is
special
rights
as
a
christian
man
i
feel
strongly
same
sex
marriage
is
wrong
and
always
will
be
i
know
there
may
be
some
very
nice
gay
people
the
feel
it
is
still
against
the
laws
god
gave
us
and
always
will
be1
and
there
are
plenty
of
same
sex
heterosexual
friends
who
would
love
to
marry
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
each
others
work
benefits
but
they
cant
are
they
discriminted
against
based
on
their
sexual
orientation
too0
during
his
tenure
in
office
the
supreme
judicial
court
sjc
of
massachusetts
issued
a
ruling
claiming
that
denial
of
marriage
to
same
sex
couples
was
not
legal
governor
romney
reacted
to
this
ruling
by
asserting
that
he
supported
the
establishment
of
civil
unions
to
satisfy
the
court
decision
that
this
legal
alternative
be
available
at
this
same
time
governor
romney
asserted
his
view
that
marriage
was
a
special
union
between
one
man
and
one
woman1
the
bills
absolute
prohibition
of
the
word
marriage
by
spouses
who
are
the
same
sex
is
more
than
semantic
the
dissimilitude
between
the
terms
civil
marriage
is
a
considered
choice
of
language
that
reflects
a
demonstrable
assigning
of
samesex
largely
homosexual
couples
to
secondclass
status0
we
have
found
middle
ground
on
gay
marriage
the
maryland
amendment
includes
language
that
does
not
force
pastors
etc
to
perform
same
sex
marriage
i
think
this
is
the
way
to
go
even
though
some
progressives
would
like
to
use
the
gay
community
to
destroy
religion1
in
dreams
the
shadow
appears
as
a
person
of
the
same
sex
as
the
dreamer
the
shadow
does
not
have
to
be
an
opponent
as
it
is
a
part
of
ourselves
we
need
to
take
it
give
it
love
and
compassion
control
it
guide
it
the
shadow
will
only
become
hostile
when
it
is
not
understood
or
is
neglected0
wow
thats
amazing
to
have
all
that
familyfriend
support
being
gay
in
the
black
community
is
not
easy
i
know
my
family
would
not
be
that
supportive
if
someone
in
the
family
came
out
and
got
married
to
someone
of
the
same
sex0
all
i
have
to
say
is
why
drag
kids
into
that
situation
now
the
little
boy
thinks
it
right
to
go
around
kissing
the
same
sex
thanks
for
stripping
away
their
innocence
and
to
those
who
words
of
god
which
are
never
wrong
if
you
think
that
god
is
wrong

him
on
judgement

my
24
year
male
cousin
died
last
year
from
problems
arising
from
anal
sex
i
know
people
truly
feel
theyre
born
gay
but
our
bodies
were
not
designed
by
god
to
be
used
in
that
way
do
some
research
were
in
a
free
country
and
people
can
do
what
they
choose
within
the
scope
of
the
law
but
same
sex
marriage
and
gay
sex
has
nothing
to
do
with
god1
in
may
obama
announced
on
abc
news
that
he
thought
same
sex
couples
should
be
able
to
get
married
the
president
had
previously
said
that
he
opposed
gay
marriage
but
said
in
may
that
his
views
were
personal
and
did
not
represent
a
policy
change1
a
pew
research
center
poll
conducted
in
april
found
that
49
of
africanamericans
oppose
legalized
samesex
marriage
compared
with
39
who
support
it
but
that
shows
a
softening
on
the
position
in
recent
years
in
2008
only
26
of
blacks
were
in
favor
of
same
sex
marriage
according
to
the
same
pew
poll1
among
africanamericans
i
think
samesex
marriage
will
be
a
nonissue
in
the
election
jones
told
cnn
we
just
have
no
evidence
what
so
ever
in
slippage
of
support
for

after

you
can
mix
it

whenever
you
make
a
tofu
stir
fry
or
a
curry
with
tofu
its
best
fry
the
tofu
first
and
then
do
the
rest
of
the
stir
fry
after
so
to
actually
fry
your
tofu
once
its
cut
up
youll
need
a
really
good
nonstick
pan
or
well
seasoned
cast
iron
skillet
itll
be
very
frustrating
if
your
tofu
is
sticking
all
over
the
place

from
experience

our
only
complaint
came
from
the
fried
pickles
they
were
plentiful
especially
at
the3
happy
hour
price
and
came
with
a
nice
seasoned
ranch
but
they
were
extremely
salty
and
left
a
large
pool
of
grease
atm
guessing
if
you
were
sitting
at
the
bar
drinking
some
of
their
ridiculously
lame
beer
selection
these
would
be
an
acceptable
bar
snack0

opinions

not

into

your
dad
participated
in

before

hes
had
the
manicured
follicles

prove
it
his

was
a
masculine
work
of

projected

it
very

whatever
it

had0
the

widely
rumored

seasoned
observers
know
that

others
are
so
far
down
the

chain
that
they
dont

are
also
instances
where
cartel
operatives
coopt

already
controlled

better

some
so
feared
the

all
specified
at

be

beware1
not
to
go

the
doctor
for
a
very
treatable
cancer
because
your
faith
would
heal
you
now
my
brotherinlaw
is
six
feet
under
because
he
took
the
advice
we
tried
to
reason
with
him
in
vain
by
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
difference
between
pulling
a
bad
tooth
or
removing
a
cancerous
tumor1
cant
we
just
shoot
the
guy
already
im
surprised
hes
still
alive
i
hate
trolls
and
believe
that
they
have
no
human
rights
chris
dodd
is
obviously
a
troll
and
as
such
should
just
be
buried
six
feet
under
re
hes
right1
the
trailer
for
buried
is
a
solid
minute
of
nothing
but
a
black
screen
with
a
voiceover
of
a
man
panting
and
calling
911
not
knowing
where
he
is
or
what
happened
to
him
until
the
very
end
where
the
flame
of
a
lighter
reveals
that
hes
six
feet
under
and
very
much
alive0
my
future
and
dreams
are
six
feet
under
and
i
am
still
digging
my
grave
i
want
to
fight
and
reclaim
my
american
and
cincinnatian
identity
even
if
the
only
thing
i
can
afford
is
the
sound
of
my
voice
and
tears1
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
keep
saying
it
until
they
put
me
six
feet
under1
are
don
t
take
this
lying
down
we
will
put
you
six
feet

it

is
ready
and
raring
to

in

in
ancient
times
the
dead
were
buried
with
their
beloved
artifacts
and
belongings
this
coming
funeral
will
probably
follow
a
similar
ritual
the
most
important
item
to
go
six
feet
under
is
the
dictionary
of
illusion
and
deception
and
its
famous
entries
such
as
the
peace
process
the
only
democracy
in
the
middle
east
a
peaceloving
nation
parity
and
reciprocity
and
a
humane
solution
to
the
refugee
problem1
to
say
that
my
motivation
for
not
liking
christians
was
instead
that
i
liked
to
get
drunk
and
sleep
around
is
insulting
to
the
point
that
i
cant
believe
a
christian
would
say
it1
women
need
to
fix
their
broken
selves
and
men
need
to
sleep
around
did
i
just
read
that
correctly
good
grief
i
find
this
advice
both
comical
and
shocking
in
its
sexism1

bucky
was
feeling
the
pain
again
just
a
few
weeks
before
the
huskies
2011
fall
camp
was
to
start
he
decided
not
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
tough
it
out
for
two
days
the
second
day
bucky

went
to
sleep
around
11
pm

didnt
wake
up0

a

that

for
the
orphanage
that
inspired
the
idea
was
born
it
started
small
raising
money
to
buy
foam
mattresses
and
coverlets
so
the
girls
wouldnt
have
to
sleep
with
only
thin
straw
mats
between
them
and
the
concrete
floor0
in
the
sequence
celebrating

were
greeted
with

no

that
night
was
able
to
sleep
with
the
light
off
a
40
foot
inflatable
voldemort0
i
skipped
the
election
coverage
last
night
went
to
sleep
with
the
girls
instead
and
actually
got
the
coffee
rolling
this
morning
before
i
even
turned
the
tv
on
im
happy
the
election
is
over
and
hope
to
see
the
partisan
gap
close
as
we
all
work
together
for
our
country0

my

30
minutes

quick
to
snarkily

i
am
so
confused
as
to
what
you
were
reading
or
who
you
were
talking
to
that
you
think
no
one
talks
about
how
hard
breastfeeding
is
or
how
you
dont
get
any
sleep
with
a
newborn0
our
baby
at
8
months
still
sleeps
with
us
about
3
hours
a
night
i
probably
wont
try
to
correct
it
until
maybe
1
up
at
7am
but
he
improved
on
his
own
whatever
works
for
parent
and
baby
is
whats
best
though
sleeping
without
a
pillow
really
sucks
we
had
a
major
scare
so
i
never
sleep
with
a
pillow

all
my

hit
15
they
look
like
roadkill
for
another
35
years
and
then
they
sleep
their
way
to
jesus
as
long
as
theyre
still
kicking
the
ings
it
just
means
youre
indulging
all
their
vices

theyre
thanking
you
for
letting

impose
on
you

all

i
reentered
the
cave
to
stoke
the
fire
curling
up
beside
it
for
warmth
but
i
could
not
sleep
without

spent
the

rewriting

both
my

make
my

unhappy

that
i
must
stop

the
blog
can
lull
you
to
sleep
with
the
pet
threads

the
what
is
your
favorite
white

it
is
still
a
no

barred
political
forum
with
plenty
of
agita

hot
air

the
thing
that
makes

my
kids
usually
would
come
upstairs
and
sleep
with
me
they
were
very
little
and
i
heard
them
over
by
the
steps
but
they
didnt
come
on
over
to
the
bed
so
i
turned
on
the
light
and
it
wasnt

was
a
dark

up

too
early
because

was
on

little
slumber
party
with
my

so
she
could
sleep
with
our
puppy
olive
she
has
is
being
kennel
trained
i
stayed
on
the
couch
with
her
and
the
puppy
to
discourage
the
puppy
getting
any
ideas
i
have
tried
to
get
her
to
sleep
in
a
bed
upstairs
but
chasing
cats
is
better
than
sleeping
in

was
surprised
when
another

a
stout
woman
who
he
barely
acknowledged
her1
his
description
appeared

attempted
to
get
out

northwardly
and
probably
may
have
taken
the
same
direction
now1
that
evening
after
the
retirement
both
canadian
brigades
were
relieved
and
sent
into
reserve
trenches
although
when
on
monday
the
26th
the
germans
again
pressed
forward
our
men
of
the
2nd
brigade
worn
out
and
reduced
to
one
quarter
the
original
strength
marched
with
stout
hearts
once
again
into
the
fray0
when
he
came
out
the
table
in
the
living
room
was
set
for
three
the
stout
old
dame
who
was
placing
the
plates
paid
no
attention
to
him
seemed
from
her
expression
to
scorn
him
and
all
his
kind
he
withdrew
as
far
as
possible
out
of
her
path
and
picked
up
a

love
these

on
the
other
side
of
the
debate
people
are
in
denial
not
only
about
the
science
of
climate
change
but
also
about
manipulation
and
deception
by
other
climate
change
deniers
they
stoutly
ignore
far
graver
evidence
of
falsification
and
fabrication
by
their
own
side

when
there
is
smoking
gun
evidence
that
their
champions
have
secretly
taken
money
from

to
make

to
account
or
to
sustain
any
standards

moments
later
a
white
car
pulled
up
and
i
heard
the
familiar
voice

walked
over
and
met
her

to
ride

hey
at

she
was

finally
looked

himself
last

although
he
did
not
see
the

too
much
the
stanford
d
is
stout
and
while
cal
did
a
nice
job
against
the
ducks
for
a
while
in
the

they
were

overmatched

to

to
open
up
the

for

even
more
so
with

that

also
drafted
stout

brought

chad

all
three
players
would
ultimately
play
at
a
pro
bowl
level1
very
stout
set
of
linebackers
especially
against
the
run
who
can
cover
the
middle
of
the
field
brooks
reed
and
conner
barwin
have
proven
to
be
top
level
linebackers
with
the
ability
to
rush
the
passer
together
both
outside
linebackers
have
45
sacks1
the
texans
will
be
without

which
should
just
up
fosters
touches
in
this
game
the
texans
consistently
run
the
ball
and
dont
move
away
from
it
expect
a
heavy
dose
of
foster
say

even
against

oh
and
by
the

its
not
just
their

that
are
gigantic
the
aforementioned
teo

all

long
mind
you
but
the
rest
of
notre
dames
linebackers
are
also
quite
stout
borrowing
from
a
comment
made
here
by
one
foot
down
s
eric
murtaugh
the
irish
linebackers
who
typically
see
the
field
go

and
2451
there
was
another
surprise
though
i
cant
say
it
was
shocking
mililani

dayton
furuta
in
the
second
half
of
their
comefrombehind
win
over
baldwin
furuta
who
york
calls
his

became
a
major
weapon

a
running

with
23
carries
for
118
yards
the
trojans
an
aerial
show
if
there
ever
was
one
simply
went
to
the
offseti
set
and
barreled
through
baldwins
normally
stout
defense
with
regularity0
now
we
admit
that
some
of
the
national
progressive
partys
platform
may
seem
somewhat
radical
but
difficult
times
call
for
difficult
measures
indeed
the
beloved
founder
of
our
party
was
badly
wounded
in
an
assassination
attempt
asked
how
he
felt
he
stoutly
replied

our
procession
consisted
of
the

the
twelve

the
six
stout
middleaged

mr

choy
the

the
bishop
of
victoria
and
myself
but
the

regarded
the
unwonted
spectacle
with
extreme
apathy1
essentially
a
buckler
is
a
small
shield
about
the
size
of
a
large
dinner
plate
it
often
accompanied
a
swordsman
as
an
aid
in

the

training
replica
is
stoutly
made
and
has
a
thick
sturdy

boss
to
protect
the
hand
and
a
rugged

that
will
withstand
plenty
hard
of
use0
the
longhorns
have
been
especially
porous
against
the
pass
ranking
107th
nationally
allowing
83
yards
per
attempt
for
perspective
that
is
level
with
former
conferencemates
colorado
and
worse
than
baylor
much
of
that
was
oklahoma
state
though
texas
was
gashed
by
wyoming
99
yards
per
attempt
through
the
air
and
was
not
that
stout
against
ole
miss
75
a
major
reason
has
been
conceding
big
plays
through
four
30
yards
or
longer0
painter
looks
like
a
freak
did
you
guys
get
the
feeling
that
the
defense
was
laying
off
or
lax
for
most
of
the
practice
or
that
the
offense
is
looking
crisper
and
better
than
some
may
have
expected
if
theyre
looking
this
good
against
a
stout
defense
like
ours
hmmm0
all
three
stories

us
that
an

is
only
the
prophecy
of

swiss

hard
to
figure
that
one
all
the
optimism
for

stemmed
from
the
idea
that
uga
senior
defense
would
be
stout
hasnt
been
and
doesnt
look
like
it
will
be
unbelievable0
then
just
use
a
stout
whisk
and
a
large
bowl
mixing
this
will
take
a
little
muscle
work
at
first
but
by
the
time
you
add
the
eggs
and
cream
the
batter
will
loosen
up
enough
to
mix
more
easily
dont
leave
any
lumps
of

you
may
have
to
do
several
bursts

of

always
carry

just
in

i
am

everyone
with

find

should
be

why
the

it
went

its
not

still
laugh

regarding
the
venereal
situation
oldestablished
reticence
makes
it
difficult
to
state
in
plain
terms
the
exact
state
of
the
case
and
that
although
the
times
at
last
has
escaped
from
circumlocutions
and
allows
the
term
syphilis
to
appear
upon
its
pages
and
a
royal
commission
upon
venereal
diseases
and
its
conclusions
have
been
extensively
commented
upon
in
the
public
press
and
wherever
thoughtful
men
and
women
are
congregated1
other
types
of
civil
war
medical
treatment
seem
almost
like
medieval
torture
incredibly
some
surgeons
cauterized
the
anus
to
treat
dysentery
and
even
the
penis
to
treat
venereal
disease
pneumonia
patients
were
frequently
bled
or
had
heated
mustard
plasters
placed
on
their
chests
to
draw
out
fluid
from
the
lungs

ailment

i
think
that
if
you
leftist
pigs
want
to
start
legislating
what
we
can
eat
and
how
much
of
it
we
can
consume
we
need
to
start
legislating
and
restricting
your
unsafe
sexual
practices
because
those
practices
lead
to
venereal
diseases
and
hiv
which
cause
an
explosion
of
healthcare
costs
how
about
we
tax
you
for
your
sexual
practices
maybe
tax
abortions
which
cause
long
term
mental
consequences
on
the
female0

am
not
hostile
toward

that

the

one
puzzle
about
existentialism
is
why
it
took
so
long
to
come
into
existence
the
eponymous
hero
of
the
mesopotamian
epic
of
gilgamesh
which
was
written
in
the
second
millennium
bc
is
plunged
into
gloomy
thoughts
of
his
own
mortality
after
his
beloved
friend
enkidu
expires
gilgamesh
belatedly
realises
that
makes
all
of
life
seem
empty
to
him1
there
is
so
much
that
is
merely
instinct
in
us
but
we
go
against
our
instincts
because
of
what
we
wer
taught
even
now
we
cant
overcome
our
instincts
all
of
the
time
granted
what
we
are
speaking
about
is
over
simplified
but
the
idea
does
stand
and
it
is
backed
up
by
many
facts
the
fact
im
not
at
college
trying
to
right
a
paper
is
the
reasonim
not
going
to
make
a
page
report0
i
will
say
the
presentation
was
excellent
the
plates
were
definitely
pretty
however
in
my
opinion
looks
dont
count
for
much
if
they
arent
backed
up
by
taste0
the
casual
one
had
a
great
night
at
the
tar
prediction
table
close
behind
was
the
pro
who
backed
up
her
great
performance
the
prior
week
overall
the
crew
is
learning
a
lot
about
the
teams
and
is
making
better
predictions
each
week
in
weeks
one
and
two
our
average
score
was
and
points
respectively
in
weeks
three
and
four
our
average
score
was
and0
it
does
appear
that
i
can
erase
my
nook
and
start
over
would
this
give
me
the
ability
to
create
a
new
encryption
keyi
have
all
my
books
backed
up
on
calibre
so
it
would
be
no
loss
to
wipe
it
out

all
your

wells

larod

gets
another

up

alfonso
smith
when
wells
does
play
again
he
figures
to
start
but
depending
on
his
rust
the
situation
is
likely
flexible0
hmmm
c
makes
a
good
point
his
numbers
may
not
be
empirically
backed
up
but
his
position
is
definitely
not
far
fetched
in
fact
i
think
its
quite
pragmatic
of
course
i
hope
he
or
she
is
wrong
but
well
just
have
to
see
safe
wishes
to
all
keep
your
heads
down

your

dry0
next
thing
that
happened
chris
showed
me
the
credible
backup
email
theres
no
question
at
all
then
or
now
that
it
came
from
the
real
student
and
it
backed
up
many
elements
of
his
story
so
we
had
a
very
complicated
situation
x
was
telling
the
truth
about
his
habit
of
sock
puppetry
but
lying
about
tj
being
a
wholesale
fabrication
he
was
definitely
not
x
was
making
chris
look
like
a
liar
and
chris
was
not
a
liar0

you

rather
than
backing
them
up
with
well
nothing
sorry
dude
but
thats
shit
you
learn
in
middle
school
thats
basic
journalism
not
that
most
media
bothers0
nothing
in
your
blanket
statements
of
how
wonderful
the
gop
is
backed
up
by
any
evidence
yes
they
support
and
love

but
god
forbid
that

pops

at

churchill
got
one
too
how

from
the
vegetable
marrow
you
derive
no
nourishment
and
certainly
you
derive
no
exercise
for
being
a
soft
weak
spiritless
thing
it
offers
no
resistance
whatever
and
it
looks
a
good
deal
like
a
streak
of
solidified
fog
and
tastes
like
the
place
where
an
indisposed
carrot
spent
the
night
next
to
masqueraded
in
a
skin
and
called
itself
a
vegetable
yet
its

over
there
seem
to
set
much

it0
the

also
put
runners
on
first

second

with
only
one
out
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
as
they
tried
to
rally
from
three
runs
down
but
designated
hitter
jon
wilson
could
only
muster
an
easy
fly
ball
to
shallow
right
field
and
pinchhitter
tyler
bennett
grounded
out
to

anyone

how

could
i
carry
someone
down

do
they
have

in

yes
they
do
because
they
sent
one
for
aron
ralston
when
he
cut
his
arm
off
how
long
does
that
take
dont
know
what
i
can
do
for

it
also
seems
subjectively
likely
that

likely

naturally

he
made
a

it
was
too
tough
as
andino
broke
his
bat
and
lofted
a

hit
over

things
got
sticky0
relax
baby
he
said
coaxingly
dont
strain
your

didnt
much
like
playing
into
rachels
conceited
demeanor
but
he
was
experienced
and
knew
she
would
stay
mad
if
he
didnt
besides
hed
gotten
to
second

with
her
before
and
he
was
willing
to
do
anything
to
make
that
happen
again

if
theres

left

maybe
we
can
talk

until
those
other

are
done

its
bullshit
it

around

him
most
of

verbally
giving

the

an

doesnt

and
yes
maybe
even
god
allows
satan
to
tempt
us
like
he
did
with
job
just
to
make
sure
that
we
really
love
him
the
same
way
a
jealous
girlfriend
would
get
a
friend
to
try
and
sleep
with
her
boyfriend
so
he
could
win
her
trust
by
not
cheating1

each
time
we
sleep
with
a
houri
we
find
her

besides
the
penis
of
the

never
softens
the
erection
is
eternal
the
sensation
that
you
feel
each
time
you
make
love
is
utterly
delicious
and
out
of
this
world
and
were
you
to
experience
it
in

you
would
faint

chosen

women
he
married

all
will
have
appetizing
vaginas1
for
what
its
worth
i
find
it
reprehensible
that
theres
a
huge
push
to
demonize
people
based
on
who
they
want
to
sleep
with
or
who
they

elegant

much

most
men
would
not
want
to
sleep
with
a
woman
who
was
assigned
a
different
gender
at
birth
who
cares
why
to
be
explained
i
suspect
however
that
it
has
to
do
with
how
the
men
in
question
define
their
sexuality
and
their
refusal
to
acknowledge
the
woman
in
question
as
a
real
woman

again
not
wanting
to
sleep
with
or
be
in
a
relationship
with
someone
because
theyve
surgically
altered
their
genitals
does
not
automatically
that
person
transphobic
even
though
the
transsexual
person
is
by
all
means
a
real
woman
or
man
the
fact
still
remains
that
not
everyone
wants
to
fuckbe
with
someone
who
was
not
born
a
biological
femalemale
how
dare
they1
so
you
admit
its
transphobic
but
think
we
should
humor
that
transphobia
to
avoid
consent
issues
whats
next
we
should
do
a
full
ancestry
research
on
ourselves
before
we
sleep
with
someone
to
humor
their
possible
racist
fears1
i
can
not
even
believe
some
of
the
shit
getting
said
in
this
thread
nobody
has
the
right
to
know
something
about
another
persons
history
unless
it
materially
affects
them
ie
previous
children
if
that
makes
you
uncomfortable
dont
sleep
with
anybody
whose
history
in
whatever
aspect
is
meaningful
to
you
is
unclear
to
you
problem
solved1
how
on
earth
could
you
know
that
obviously
anyone
in
this
situation
wanted
to
sleep
with
a
woman
who
was
assigned
a
different
gender
at
birth
if
learning
about
her
history
causes
the
man
to
change
his
mind
then
surely
thats
more
about
something
he
doesnt
like
about
himself1
kev
if
it
is
sooooooooo
motherfucking
important
that
you
only
sleep
with
cis
people
ask
people
you
date
if
theyre
trans
and
you
know
try
not
to
be
so
ragingly
transphobic
in
the
process
that
theyll
lie
and
theyre
placing
their
lives
above
their
desire
to
assuage
your
burning
terror
of
their
genitalia1
i
would
be
more
concerned
if
i
were
you
with
shows
like
gossip
girl
that
turn
young
women
into
bitchy
stereotypes
with
nothing
to
do
but
cut
each
other
down
and
sleep
with
everyone
in
their
school
just
saying1
why
dont
they
just
disclose
that
theyre
a
racist
transphobic
asshole
first
and
then
well
know
what
to
tell
them
because
im
sure
thats
a
dealbreaker
for
a
lot
of
people
i
think
there
could
be
a
consent

there
cis

should

given

surely
agricultural

you
may

after

hmmm
satyanarayana
might
of
course
be
working
for
monsanto
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
she
or
he
has
posted
an
incredibly
stupid
comment
deprived
of
all
insight
into
this
most
disturbing
situation0
the
minister
of
war
has
lately
asserted
that
every
individual
transported
to
algeria
has
cost
the
state
8000
francs
now
it
is
certain
that
these
poor
creatures
could
have
lived
very
well
in
france
on
a
capital
of
4000
francs
i
ask
how
the
french
population
is
relieved
when
it
is
deprived
of
a
man
and
of
the
means
of
subsistence
of
two
men0
we
should
have
scored
a
onetwo
finish
but
jenson
was
deprived
of
an
easy
second
place
by
a
fuel
system
problem
he
said
thats
frustrating
for
him
and
frustrating
for
us
but
the
important
thing
is
that
our
car
is
a
winner
weve
now
won
three
grands
prix
in
a
row
and
both
our
drivers
are
on
top
form0
so
really
this
can
turn
into
a
huge
trap
the
person
bragging
that
they
only
slept
4
hours
and
still
do
great
work
well
they
are
actually
right
with
what
they
are
saying
the
only
issue
is
that
they
have
no
brainpower
to
steer
them
back
to
focus
once
they
lose
attention
even
worse
so
sleepdeprived
people
dont
notice
their
decrease
in
performance0
dear
skirt
i
like
you
quite
a
bit

you
gave
me
a
mini
heart
attack
when
i
tried

embarrassed
of

you
actually

either
i
have
to
lay
off
the

fro
yo
or
i
could
just
keep
living
in

it

that

factors
associated
with
child
abuse0
our
discussion
now
moves
to
the
broad
range
of
intervention
strategies
used
to
deal
with
child
abuse
most
intervention
programs
emphasize
psychotherapeutic
treatment
although
the
strategy
of
prevention
through
education
is
becoming
increasingly
important0
many
factors
appear
to
be
associated
with
child
abuse
age
and
marital
status
of
the
parents
income
employment
and
emotional
and
personal
characteristics
of
both
parents
and
children
among
others0
interventions
to
deal
with
child
abuse
range
from
the
societal
changing
laws
and
values
to
the
social
providing
social
and
practical
supports
to
vulnerable
parents
to
the
individual
psychotherapy
to
increase
selfesteem
most
programs
that
are
explicitly
intended
to
treat
child
abusers
are
psychotherapeutically
oriented
and
some
of
these
programs
explicitly
attempt
to
increase
the
selfesteem
of
abusing
parents0

another
thing
the
perspective
of
women
who
sleep
around
even
by
liberals
really
hasnt
changed
men
still
lose
respect
for
women
who
are
easily
seduced
men
still
do
not
look
favorably
on
women
who
behave
that
way
even
when
they
encourage
it
it
is
hypocritical
to
say
the
least1
ask
about
work
this
one
is
can
be
a
little
tricky
because
the
conversation
could
end
up
sounding
like
a
job
interview
still
if
you
can
handle
it
carefully
and
keep
it
short
and
sweet
nt
forget
that
the
person
may
be
studying
retired
or
between
jobs
here
are
some
suggested
starters1
this
very
hearing
proves
the
subversiveness
and
hence
the
value
remind
us
that
the
gleaming
and
heartless
steel
and
glass
structures
of
the
state
apparatus
can
one
day
pass
away
it
therefore
creates
an
unconscious
sense
of
opposition
and
hope0
i
dont
know
if
all
of
that
is
true
but
the
hours
i
have
spent
dwelling
on
this
whole
ordeal
i
have
come
more
convinced
none
of
it
makes
any
sense
the
accusations
do
not
match
the
questions
the
questions
had
nothing
to
do
with
child
abuse
the
questions
were
all
about
what
i
may
or
may
not
have0
its
sad
to
imagine
all
the
sheeple
that
still
think
they
live
in
a
free
country
thank
you
for
sharing
this
this
is
why
i
refuse
to
fly
on
planes
yes
none
of
the
questions
had
anything
to
do
with
child
abuse
allegations0
this
blog
is
a
little
over
a
year
old
sherrie
however
to
all
other

i
would
advise
any
and
all
parents
to
contact
and
have
present
an
attorney
during
any
visitation
with
child
protective
services
you
your
child
and
the
rest
of
your

have
legal

are

to
be
trampled
on

you
fail
to
do
so0

developed
this

format
while
working
in
places
where
humor
and
cheer
are
the
only
medicines
to
see
patients
recover
or
pass
away
cheerfully
if
this
format
worked
in
such
places
why
not
anywhere
else1
for
the
things
which
are
seen
are
temporal
all

also
be
a
huge

currently
if

definitely
appreciate
that

i
was
just
thinking
about
how
horrible
it
used

be

when
madame

my

i
both

once
we
get

i
plan
on
getting
a
private

as
well
and
his
is
through
a
private
group
it
is
frustrating
to
see
someone
pass
away
and
not
have
life
insurance
especially
when
people
assume
that
they
did
because
they
left
their
employer
so
i
want
to
second
what
one
of
the
other
commenters
wrote
about
looking
into
private
plans
as
well1
for
those
fans
who
want
to
join
blum
in
the
world
of
voice
acting
he
recommends
studying
acting
and
improv
and
cautions
that
actors
need
a
strong
selfesteem
to
motivate
them
between

an
inevitability
in

five

generally
went

what

she
skews

one

safe

indeed
was
it
the

is
that

all

right
my
guess
is
that
some
preppy
little
group
of
bitches
started
spreading
rumors
because
they
have
nothing
better

this
was
the
result1

i
am
also
a

dont

the

is
that

would
label
both
her

the

as

have
proven
to
be
dumb
in

are
probably
brilliant
on

they
are
both
probably
hypocritical

prior

such

perish
the
thought
but
the
worlds
oldest
profession
salesmanship
is
often
a
profession
salespeople
dont
produce
anything
they
lead
others
to
do
it
for
them
salespeople
as
opposed
to
merchants
dont
do
anything
except
provide
information
and
to
attempt
to
change
the
behavior
of
others0
an
actual
example
of
this
is
of
a
woman
who
was
sleeping
around
and
who
felt
guilty
about
it
however
as
she
worked
through
the
guilt
her
desire
to
sleep
around
disappeared
while
she
thought
the
guilt
held
her
sexual
encounters
in
check
and
that
if
removed
would
lead
to
more
onenight
stands
the
truth
was
the
dialectic
opposite
the
guilt
sustained
the
action
the
removal
of
the
obstacle
the
guilt
removed
the
thing
that
the
obstacle
appeared
to
hold
at
bay
the
sleeping

no

some

lack

politics
having
ownership

time
in

the

christian
faith
believes
that
it
is
wrong
for
male
or
female
to
sleep
around
i
married
as
a
virgin
as
a
virgin
and
i
can
tell
you
this
society
glorifies
slutty
behavior
and
and
responsible
thing
and
resist
the
urge
to
have
sex
until
they
are
fully
willing
to
deal
with
the
consequences
therein1
as
i
spent
every
day
of
my
between
jobs
periods
tirelessly
leaving
no
stone
unturned
in
my
efforts
to
secure
a
job
one
key
aspect
of
my
efforts
was
to
network
my
socks
off
in
doing
this
i
became
well
acquainted
with
many
who
were
having
toolong
experiences
similar
to
mine1
though
i
come
from
a
generation
that
finds
i
and
the
others
i
met
along
the
way
found
it
necessary
to
turn
to
this
system
during
our
extended
periods
between
jobs
it
made
the
difference
in
being
able
to
make
ends
meet
and
to
not
have
to
watch
the
eroded
nest
eggs
vanish
altogether
i
think
those
are
purposes
that
this
system
which
we
all
had
paid
into
faithfully
for
decades
is
supposed
to
serve1
the
fact
that
i
and
the
many
i
met
along
the
way
who
were
having
unemployment
underemployment
experiences
similar
to
mine
spent
every
day
of
our
between
jobs
periods
tirelessly
leaving
no
stone
unturned
in
our
efforts
to
secure
a
job
serves
as
proof
that
while
we
found
it
necessary
to
turn
to
unemployment
compensation
we
found
it
unacceptable
to
abuse
the
system
this
fact
should
also
provide
clear
illustration
of
why
i
find
the
implication
of
speaker
gingrichs
position
on
this
to
be
inappropriate
and
counterproductive1

down

unemployment
was
designed
to
assist
people

unfortunately
it
has
become
a
retirement
just
like
disability
for
many
there
are
jobs
out
there
and
true
some
dont
pay
the
best

thats
when
you
work

better
this
country
can
not
sustain
itself
with
a
trend
of
a
few
working
hard
for
the
many1
if
the
oldest
profession
in
the

is

the

finding
a

begins
with
knowing
what
is
available
and
what
you
will
be
successful
doing
keep
an
open
mind
to
industries
professions
and
other
jobs
you
might
not
have
normally
considered
think
first
of
your
abilities
and
skills
next
know
what
the
position
is
worth
and
how
much
value
you
can
bring
to
the
company
finally
remain
selective
in
your
search
because
taking
a
job
in
between
jobs
should
be
a
final
resort0
your
flippant
attitude
towards
the
idea
of
a
woman
wanting
to
make
it
home
to
have
dinner
with
her
family
shows
how
little
you
understand
working
women
in
this
country
they
wantneed
flex
time
women
right
now
deal
with
child
care
responsibilities
this
is
unfair
yes
but
i
know
that
women
do
want
to
spend
time
with
their
children
and
we
should
focus
on
ways
of
making
that
possible
the
world
has
changed
the
family
work
structure
has
changed
hours
in
the
work
place
should
change
too0
just
as
with
child
molesters
if
the
mental
illness
can
not
be
cured
the
person
can
not
be
trusted
to
be
amongst
society
and
should
therefore
not
be
let
out
into
it
societies
have
mores
if
a
person
is
either
unwilling
to
follow
them
as
in
rapists
murderers
thieves
or
unable
to
follow
them

an
easy
one
to
follow

cruel
he
had
to
pass
away
during
what
has
shaped
up
to
be
yet
another
intriguing
college
season
especially
after
three
teams
in
the
top

lost
last

we
would
have
loved
to
hear
his
takes
on
this
crazy

for
a
few
more
weeks1

obviously
socially

explains
the
vitriol
youre
spewing
poor
thing
go
get
your
nappy
changed
and
take
a
looong
nap
hopefully
if
the
world
is
lucky
youll
pass
away
quietly
in
your
sleep
then
your
mom
can
stop
feeling
so
guilty
and
subpar
tsk
tsk
run
along
now
and
mind
that
trail
of
drool
behind
you1
as
blue
peaks
are
of
the
same
height
we
can
conclude
that
the
graph
represents
a
religious
napper
whose
optimum
siesta
time
occurs
hours
from
awakening
in
this
case
for
an
awakening
at
am
the
siesta
should
begin
at
pm
and
the
night
sleep
around
am
for
both
blue
peaks
of
all
sleep
episodes
being
at
the
optimum
hour
while
the
remaining
are
suboptimum0
v
if
men
fight
and
hurt
a
woman
with

so
that
she
gives
birth
prematurely
and
the
baby
dies
he
will
leads
people
to
other
gods
by
prophecy
or
dreams1
as
pains
on
a
woman
with

my
judgment
shall
be
revealed
or
exposed
upon
them1
there
are
also
numerous
external
risk
factors
for
dropping
out
such
as
gender
socioeconomic
status
level
of
parental
education
involvement
with
child
welfare
services
living
in
a
single
parent
home
and
having
a
parent
in
prison
given
that
the
more
risk
factors
a
student
faces
the
more
likely
heshe
is
to
drop
out
we
can
extrapolate
that
interventions
aimed
at
reducing
and
removing
these
alterable
risk
factors
will
be
more
successful
at
preventing
students
from
dropping
out0
later
in
chapter
the
bible
defines
iniquity
it
includes
such
acts
as
adultery
child
sacrifice
homosexuality
and
bestiality
homosexuality
is
singled
out
from
this
group
and
described
as
an
abomination
without
any
doubt
god
strongly
condemns
the
homosexual
act
as
iniquity
there
is
no
section
in
the
old
testament
where
god
approves
or
condones
homosexuality
the
homosexual
act
is
a
very
serious
offense
to
god
it
is
linked
with
child
sacrifice
and
bestiality
the
scriptures
to
show
this
follow0
rumors
of
beyonce
possibly
being
with
child
sparked
up
weeks
ago
during
her
intimate
nights
with
beyonce
concert
when
she
held
her
stomach
during
a
part
of
her

during
the
second

of

when
she
was
brought
forth
she
sent

in

these
are

with

shee
said
discerne
i
pray
thee
whose
are
these

when

i
agree
nintendo
took
a
different

and
made
it

can
they
do
it
againonly
time
will
tell
but
this
is
kinda
like
the

playstation
did
i
hope
it
does
well
but
i
couldnt

to
support
it

recognize
that
if
youre
between

you
probably
have
more
discretionary
time
than
most
of
your
valuable

contacts
do

are
overrun
with
requests
haver
says
unless
theres
a
compelling

for
someone
to
meet

wont
make

yourself

this
age
and
its
corrupt
decadent
value
system
is
going
to
pass

there
is
a
new

coming
based
upon
eternal
values
that
new
world
the
coming
kingdom
of
god
will
be
permanent0
not
sure
how
showing
my
face
or
saying
whereim
from
would
contribute
to
the
discussion
but
i
am
willing
to
call
a
truce
if
you
lay
off
the
racist
bromides0
by
all
means
lets
support
abstinance
lets
persuade
people
not
to
sleep
around
however
the
word
slut
is
inflammatory
in
part
because
so
many
people
out
there
are
in

sluts1
lets
take
your
typical
person
who
is

to
go
untreated
until
the
point
that
they
show
up
in
the
emergency
room
and
get
admitted
to
the
hospital
for
a

one

the

worsens

that
said
with

there
is
also
the
advantage

the
tide

anyone

i

or
leave
bolivia
except
for
the
part
whereim
not
sure
we
have
the
resources
to
see
my
wifes
favorite
doctors
while
learning
a
new
language
plus
shed
have
to
lay
off
some
of
her
more
useful
medications
during
the
first
few
months
of
the
trip
andid
want
us
to
have
greater
motivations
than
my
indifference
and
her
trying
to
fulfill
the
perceived
expectations
of
other
people
before
we
go
to
all
the
trouble
of
packing
and
hopping
on
the
plane0
so
what
do
we
make
of
this
intersting
assertionnot
much
actually
the
earliest
mention
of
the
zodiac
anywhere
is
in
babylonian
records
around
bc
the
earliest
zodiac
on
a
ceiling
is
in
egypt
centuries
after
that
none
of
any
such
zodiacs
include
a
virgin
mother
with
child
in
arms
the
whole
thing
is
conpletely
based
on
late
nineteenth
century
occultic
crackpottery0
unions
are
gone
they
served
their
purpose
when
we
had
trouble
with
child
labor
laws
everything
seems
to
be
like
a
pendulum
however
far
it
swings
to
the
left
it
will
swing
to
the
right
the
unions
have
become
a
tool
of
the
dark
agenda
the
only
thing
they
ever
do
is
negotiate
raises
never
individual
help0

samesex
marriage
is
about
having
the
right
to
the
property
of
your
spouse
and
the
right
to
care
for
your

this
has
nothing
to
do
with
being
biologically
unable
to
have
children
if
a
person
that
happened
to
be
in
a
heterosexual
relationship
were
to
pass
away
than
under
marriage
laws
the
spouse
is
able
to
inherit

not
afforded
to
samesex
couples1

the
rumors

during
a
philadelphia
radio
