However, in an analysis of 2008 tax returns for the top 0.2%-- that is, those whose income tax returns reported $1,000,000 or more in income (mostly from individuals, but nearly a third from couples)-- it was found that they received 13% of all income, down slightly from 16.1% in 2007 due to the decline in payoffs from financial assets (Norris, 2010).

"Unfortunately, the abortion issue has allowed many Christians-- and conservatives as a whole-- to claim to be working to defend the most vulnerable when in fact they are turning attention and national resources away from those who are most desperately in need.

The abortion issue ends up serving as a smokescreen behind which certain politicians work in the interests of those who are the most rich and powerful. ",1
